	  <t id="1301">XAAR</t>
	  <t id="1302">Cut off from the Empire's leadership, and with much of the local religious structure lost in a freak navigational accident, the Paranid inhabitants of Wretched Skies spent much of the Shutdown building an unusual bond of blood with their Split neighbors through constant violent clashes. \n\nStrangely, the influence of the Split had something of a stabilizing effect on these leaderless Paranid; rather than descending into madness or despondence, the Paranid of Wretched Skies rallied around a new doctrine that combined scattered elements of the traditional Paranid mythos with the brutal tenets of Split culture. Once the Gates reopened, this earned them the respect of the Split Patriarch, but also the enmity of both the Godrealm and the Holy Order, a position which is held mutually by the Faithful. Unlike the Holy Order, they are much less concerned about the heresies of the "lesser races" and maintain generally nonhostile, if somewhat chilly, relationships with most other Commonwealth powers. \n\nThe fanatical beliefs of Xaar's Faithful are simple, straightforward, and impossibly heretical to the larger Paranid factions. According to the Faithful, the continued absence of Paranid Prime from the known Gate Network is no mere accident. They hold that the Priest-Emperor has shrouded the system from sight, biding his time in the darkness between the stars as a trial laid upon all Paranid, and that he someday will return to lead the Paranid people once more: embracing those who remained devoted, rewarding those who took up arms in his name, and cleansing all apostates with holy fire. As was decreed fitting of their position as subservient to the Priest-Emperor, no Paranid of Xaar's Faithful may hold a title above Deacon, and thus Xaarist affairs are generally directed by the "Deacon Triumvirate" - a triplet of councils representing the dogmatic pillars of Belief in Xaar, Force of Arms, and Mundanity of Life.</t>

	  <t id="2901">OTAS</t>
	  <t id="2902">The Optimised Technology, Armaments and Shielding Corporation, commonly known as OTAS, is a omnicorporation specialized in the design and manufacture of advanced spaceships heaquartered in Legend's Home. In the pre-Shutdown era, OTAS technologies and ships were highly advanced, often leading the cutting edge of Commonwealth scientific advancement, granting the corporation a prominent position on the political starscape of the old Commonweath of Planets.\n\nJust prior to the Great Collapse, OTAS launched an attack on Akeela's Beacon in an escalatory response to the passing of certain industry regulations by the Argon Federation. Seen as an act of terrorism by the Argon, the resulting Argon military response was cut short by Gate Shutdown. While the exact history of the period is lost to the chaos of the Great Dark, it is clear that the Argon response failed to bring OTAS to heel and the corporation now holds full administrative and military control of the formerly Argon sectors in their local region. \n\nHaving evolved beyond a simple technologies corporation, the massive OTAS commercial enterprise now operates as a fully independent star nation. Featuring locally appointed representatives from each controlled sector sitting on the board of directors and a functional state apparatus that earns generally favourable public sentiment, any scars of the hostile takeover have seemingly faded from memory.</t>

	  <t id="10">Planet 9</t>
	  <t id="11">Following reports of unknown vessels and sporadic disappearances in the outer Oort Cloud, the Protectorate reactivated the trans-orbital accelerator leading to the secretive "Planet 9" and established a sentry presence. Generally considered to be the edge of Terran-controlled Sol, Planet 9 is chiefly remarkable for being the sector where Beryll Syndicate operations in Terran space were finally cornered and hunted to extinction, and is officially home to little more than the occasional patrol or intrepid prospector. However, the increase in traffic accompanying the reactivation of the accelerator has led to an uptick in unknown vessel sightings, and rumours abound that the Protectorate is preparing a major military operation to establish a permanent presence and ensure that any survivors of the Beryll purge or whatever else may be lurking out in the dark are destroyed for good.</t>
	  <t id="20">McCallum Relay</t>
	  <t id="21">Found on the very outer edges of the Oort Cloud beyond an accelerator pair that was built in an effort to explore the interstellar space, this sector is now home to a previously undetected Xenon Core Matrix. Believed to have originated from replicant-capable Xenon technology carried by Beryll survivors that fled beyond Oort Cloud Beta, this sector has evidently never been disconnected from what is now known as Branch 9, displaying all the standard Xenon technologies and designs that are recognizable across the Gate Network. While it is unknown how they maintained contact during Sol's isolation from the Gate Network, the most commonly accepted theory postulates that the Beryll survivors possessed a partially-functioning Jump Beacon, which allowed the Xenon to maintain their Branch Connection for a time after disposing of their would-be Beryll captors. How these Xenon have survived so long without a reliable source of energy is a mystery, though this makes it highly vulnerable to inevitable extermination by Terran forces.</t>
	  <t id="30">{20101,31801}(Ares)</t>
	  <t id="31">Established due to a change in Protectorate doctrine focused on increasing Sol's strategic depth and resilience, the Ares sector encompasses a resource-rich region created by the orbital degradation of Phobos and bolstered through active asteroid capture from the Asteroid Belt conducted by deepspace expeditions ranging well outside the established Asteroid Belt sector. Previously overlooked due to the richness of Asteroid Belt, the increasing pressure on that sector as the first line of defense against hostile incursion has led the Protectorate to seek alternative concentrations of raw resources in the event that access to Outer Sol is lost.</t>
	  <t id="40">{20101,31301}(Hermes)</t>
	  <t id="41">Another resource extraction sector established following a shift in Protectorate defensive doctrine, the Hermes sector is much closer to the small planet and contains a large silicon-rich debris field. This field is the result of a controversial program of capturing potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and trans-solar objects and directing them into close proximity with Mercury, where they are broken up by gravitational interaction with Sol itself and settle into a close orbit. \n\nThe long-running program, first initiated to protect Earth from potential impactors, has drawn heavy and continuous criticism for the dangers that the debris field and transiting captured bodies pose to the crucial energy cell production facilities of the Mercury sector. Nonetheless, the Protectorate's insistence on maintaining the program has over time built up a massive quantity of raw material both in the regional space and fallen to the planet's surface, which now provides an important strategic reserve in the otherwise resource-poor Inner Sol region.</t>
	  <t id="50">{20005,7005}(Althes)</t>
	  <t id="51">One of the several Terran Lost Colonies, Althes once formed the gateway between Sol and her other colonies. Connected to Sol via a Terran-constructed gate in the Neptune sector, Althes provided further access to the other lost colonies of Megnir, Segaris, and eventually Aldrin. When the gates shut down, Althes remained connected to neighboring Megnir through one gate, while another realigned with a Xenon Core Matrix, plunging the two colonies into a bitter war for survival with the equally isolated Xenon Matrix. The reconnection of the gates brought little relief, as the isolated Matrix synchronized with the rest of Branch-9 and evolved far past its previous capabilities, forcing the beleaguered colonists to withdraw to Megnir or face complete destruction.</t>
	  <t id="60">{20005,7006}(Megnir)</t>
	  <t id="61">Another colony once thought to have been lost, the initial rediscovery of Megnir, followed by Segaris and Aldrin, were momentous occasions subsequently cut short by the Gate Shutdown. Remaining connected to neighbouring Althes, Megnir found itself fighting desperately against the Xenon advance alongside her sister colony during the Isolation. Though the brunt of the fighting was borne by Althes, Megnir supplied much of the men and materiel, with the colonies understanding that this was a do or die moment for both of them. It was thanks to Megnir's shipyard - initially built by the Sol government, heavily used during the Isolation, and decommissioned following induction into the Pioneers Initiative due to the immense amount of acculumated wear and tear - that the colonies were able to avoid total destruction after the loss of Althes.\n\nContact with the colony was restored when a Gate reopened and connected the two-colonies-turned-one to the third colony of Segaris, now under the flag of the Segaris Pioneers. Though Megnir was initially slated for absorption into the Protectorate itself, the Pioneers successfully made the case that the Colonies had stood together before, and deserved the right to stand together again. The continued defense of Megnir is now undertaken by the combined Pioneer forces with occasional assistance by the Terran Intervention Corps, and it is the hope of many among the system's inhabitants to reclaim Althes and make the colonies whole again.</t>

	  <t id="71">Once connected to a major Xenon sector only identified as "Core 023", the Xenon of this sector were the scourge of the Lost Colonies during the Gate Shutdown. When the gate connections began to fail, the Xenon moved extensive assets into Matrix #48, apparently foreseeing the need for the Matrix to stand alone. \n\nRemaining connected to Althes and Megnir while isolated, the local Xenon fought a deadly and protracted conflict against the neighbouring Terran Colonies, making slow but steady progress against the desperate defenders. The reopening of the gates allowed Matrix 48 to resynchronize with the Branch-9 network, catapulting its technological evolution overnight and enabling it to completely force the Terran defenders out of Althes. Though stopped at the Megnir-Althes Gate by the spirited defense of the colonists and later pushed further back by the combined forces of the Pioneers and Terran Intervention Corps, Matrix #48 remains a persistent lurking threat and source of continuing concern for the Segaris Pioneers.</t>

	  <t id="81">Even more of an enigma than Matrix #79B, this sector mirrors all of the complete unknowns as its counterpart and is confirmed to have also never been encountered before in the network. The Alliance of the Word conducted further research into the structures and discovered that the ones here pre-date those in Matrix #79B yet gave no insights as to their origin or purpose.</t>
	  <t id="90">{20005,1041}(Power Circle)</t>
	  <t id="91">Sometime before the last Xenon conflict the planet "Shipfall" was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Argon industrial coloney. Some effort had been made to re-establish the colony but had been restricted to mining and agriculture. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the sector once again fell apart as it was unable to support itself and there are currently no identified inhabitants.</t>
	  <t id="100">{20005,1041} {20402,1}(Power Circle I)</t>
	  <t id="101">Once the initial area of space utilized pre-Shutdown, now that Power Circle is again connected to the Argon, abeit the Antigone Republic now. As the Republic was already founded by colonist who overcame great adversities and became a thriving nation there are already many plans to not just reclaim the system but properly recolonize it.</t>
	  <t id="110">{20005,1041} {20402,3}(Power Circle III)</t>
	  <t id="111">Prior to the Shutdown the Federation completed the local superhighway leading much closer to the surface of the planet "Shipfall" so the fledgling new settlements could be better resupplied. Immense effort was taken to relocate the Gate which once connected to Three Worlds as well to give the venture every opportunity of success. Sadly now it seems that effort was completely wasted as not only did the colony completely die out but now that Gate connects to the enigmatic Matrix #79A and #79B.</t>
	  <t id="120">{20005,6012}(Teladi Gain)</t>
	  <t id="121">The favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector came under Teladi management who reimagined it into a destination of recreation. The Bliss Place produced the narcotic spaceweed which drew in dreamers, artists, and neo-philosophers of all races. \n\nDuring the Shutdown the sector's priorities dramatically shifted and the leisures of recreation were quickly abandoned for the harsh reality of survival. Now reconnected, the Teladi are once again set on restoring the sector to its pre-Shutdown condition.</t>
	  <t id="130">{20005,1032}(Herron's Nebula)</t>
	  <t id="131">A mineral rich system famed across space for its residents' vast consumption of space fuel and the semi-legal bootlegging which procured it. Following the Gates' reactivation Federation scouts were estatic to have rediscovered the sector but dishearten to have found it abandoned with little evidence as to the fate of the fabled workers. \n\nOnce Herron's Nebula was an Argon core sector which connected directly to Argon Prime but following the reactivations it has shifted outward yet remains close at hand.</t>
	  <t id="140">{20005,1012}(Three Worlds)</t>
	  <t id="141">Once on the border of Argon and Boron space the populated planets of this system were popular vacation destinations for the Argon high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings where the very best of Argon cuisine was available. When the Gates began to shutdown the sector saw a mass exodus of this society leaving behind only the less fortunate and workers; however, due to the excessive amount of food production in the sector they not only survived but are one of the few populations to grow and thrive.\n\nNow reconnected to the wider network the Antigone Republic formally annexed the sector following a widely supported referendum.</t>
	  <t id="150">{20005,5029}(Split Fire)</t>
	  <t id="151">Once home to much of the illicit trade in the known Network with a thriving industry of counterfeit Paranid jewellery. Pirates and smugglers traded with all races and operated as brokers for sensitive or illegal deals between the species. \n\nJust prior to the Shutdown rumors of Xenon activity began but the sector very shortly disconnected afterwards. Now Federation scouts have identified it as a Xenon Matrix and found no evidence of any organic life nor organic installations.</t>
	  <t id="160">{20005,2004}(Dark Waters)</t>
	  <t id="161">This system was rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. Heavily policed, any potentially hostile would be swiftly destroyed despite the sector itself being little more than a trading outpost. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the entire sector was evacuated to the still connected nearby Boron sectors.</t>
	  <t id="170">{20005,2015}(Mists of Elysium)</t>
	  <t id="171">The planet Elysium is described as a peaceful paradise world filled with lush plant life but with lowlands filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day yet the Boron were unconcerned by this as they remained within their deep-sea homes. \n\nNow reconnected, no Boron could be found on the planet and the thick mist has extended to covering the seas as well.</t>
	  <t id="180">{20005,2005}(Depths of Silence)</t>
	  <t id="181">The heavily guarded secret of Dark Waters, Depths of Silence was formerly home to a massive scientific black site established by the Royal Boron Military to pioneer new technologies that could give the Boron people any advantage over their enemies. \n\nOnce filled with sprawling, high-tech complexes that investigated everything from creating advanced ion-hybrid weaponry to increasing the nutrient density of BoFu, the sector is now completely overrun by a Kha'ak infestation of unknown origin. What became of the heavy security force and the research they protected remains unknown.</t>
	  <t id="190">{20005,2010}(Light Waters)</t>
	  <t id="191">Following the discovery of the North gate in Shore of Infinity, this sector was founded and colonized by the Boron. Once a mixture of food production and solar power plants, the system grew to importance to the nearby colonies. The habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size with the surface being mostly covered in water. \n\nFollowing the shutdown the local Boron retreated deep into the planet's vast ocean and abandoning the stations which fell into disrepair before ultimately burning up in the atmosphere.</t>
	  <t id="200">{20005,2025}(Shining Currents)</t>
	  <t id="201">Founded as a food production center to aid the continual growth of the Boron Queendom, the name comes from the reflection of mercury from the ocean of primary planet's moon. \n\nAs the Gates began to flicker off the Boron evacuated from Dark Waters took refuge here but they seem to have not survived the Great Collapse.</t>
	  <t id="210">{20005,2026}(Shore of Infinity)</t>
	  <t id="211">Leased by the Paranid to the Boron who once had a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants, Shore of Infinity saw limited trade between the two races and helped keep relations between them amicable. While the Paranid provided protection, the Boron lent their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranids' efforts in cyber biology. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown the sector became one of the few surviving Boron colonies, albeit just barely. Those Paranid that remained became erratic being cut off from their leaders and left in an ill-fated exodus.</t>
	  <t id="220">{20005,2020}(Reservoir of Tranquillity)</t>
	  <t id="221">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system was a source of strategic power for the Boron. Once a border colony to a local Split family, it acted as a crossroads for the nearby Boron settlements which made it particularly important for passing traders. Guarded by a lone destroyer and escorts, pirate activity was minimal and the Split had been occupied elsewhere. \n\nOnce reconnected the Alliance of the Word found a few scattered Split wrecks and salvaged them for information. Unfortunately there was litte of value other than the markings of Family Rhy.</t>
	  <t id="230">{20005,3026}(Duke's Domain)</t>
	  <t id="231">A highly agriculturally developed system, Duke's Domain provided much of the Soja Beans forming the basis of the Paranid diet. The highly ionised water of the systme's planet contains rare organic minerals which greatly improve the flavour of beans nurtured in it. \n\nThe system suffered particularly heavy losses in the last Xenon conflict and following the initial gate shutdowns it suffered even further as local Paranid could not cope with being disconnected nor had the resources to maintain their stations.</t>
	  <t id="240">{20005,3038}(Perpetual Sin)</t>
	  <t id="241">For a long time an insignificant system seeing only occasional Kha'ak skirmishes, it grew to being proof that those considered to be beyond redemption can be brought back onto the path. On the third day, of the third month, after having fallen into disgrace and being banished here, a Paranid scout managed to triangulate the location of a jumpgate leading to a then-unknown system. \n\nRegaining the respect of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, this scout was sent to explore the system but was never seen again. \n\nThe discovery of this active gate, in close proximity to the Second Duchy, was seen as furher evidence that the Paranid Empire was destined for greatness and helped PerpetualSin itself to gain some favour.</t>
	  <t id="250">{20005,3038} {20402,1}(Perpetual Sin I)</t>
	  <t id="251">Once initially the original location of the Southern gate leading to Duke's Citadel prior to the Paranid moving it even further South. Perpetual Sin I was established to further study the gate of legend and prior to the shutdown Paranid scientists discovered yet another gate floating lifeless and in a decaying orbit at the very extreme edge of the solar system. While there are no indications of their success the trapped Paranid appear to have been making attempts to reactivate these gates.</t>
	  <t id="260">{20005,3038} {20402,3}(Perpetual Sin III)</t>
	  <t id="261">A refuge for the Paranid who wish to seek the same redemption as the fabled scout of old, Perpetual Sin III has been designated as the site of their ultimate potential salvation and is the only acceptable place for these banished Paranid to gather within the Holy Order without risk of being executed. \n\nAs has became tradition, on the third day, of the third month, of this third system; disgraced Paranid assemble to find either renewed purpose and redemption or further disgrace and damnation. Those who return to the holy path are given this singular chance and should they fail in their duties again will be executed on sight.</t>
	  <t id="270">{20005,3018}(Sanctum Verge)</t>
	  <t id="271">A newly discovered system, Sanctum Verge has been selected by the reclusive Pontifex of the Holy Order as a new holy site of the three-dimensionality and on the cusp of prophetic wonder. \n\nWhile the endgoals of the Pontifex are unknown it is rumoured that the sector is to be built up to further support nearby Pontifex's Claim as it is on the frontline against the Godrealm. Yet another rumour is that the Holy Order had actually found something of immense value in the sector and are now trying to hide the truth.</t>
	  <t id="280">{20005,3003}(Pontifex' Seclusion)</t>
	  <t id="281">The last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors, this sector was famed for its lack of hospitality and said to be a retreat for the Pontifex should he need to leave the main sectors and be isolated for any reason. Once deep within the Second Duchy it was hard to reach due to the pirate activity along the way but following the reactivation it has since been absorbed into the Holy Order of the Pontifex.</t>
	  <t id="290">{20005,3045}(Unholy Descent)</t>
	  <t id="291">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonist of not following the Paranid religion. Now once again connected it appears Xhar'Bar claimed the lives of those heretical colonists, depriving the Holy Order the chance to purge them in the name of holy Pontifex Maximus Haereticus.</t>
	  <t id="300">{20005,9034}(Cathedral of Xaar)</t>
	  <t id="301">A system which had just been discovered and claimed by the Paranid prior to the beginning of the Collapse, Cathedral of Xaar was slated to become a far flung temple in service to the holy three-dimensionality. These ideas were dashed when the sector was once again thrown into the dark and those Paranid within driven to madness. Now unveiled once again, the Godrealm seeks to reinvigorate the plans of old and have consecrated it as a holy site once again.</t>
	  <t id="310">{20005,3023}(Clarity's End)</t>
	  <t id="311">Long-range scout patrols from Cardinal's Domain ventured upon this sector at the same time as the arrival of a mining expedition from Aladna Hill. The resulting tensions did little but re-open old wounds. Few Paranid would deny the opportunity to fan the flames of a war brought over from the old world. \n\nHaving now been reconnected to the Network via Cardinal's Domain, the Cardinal himself has issued orders to explore the sector so they can better exploit its resources and further establish the new Second Duchy.</t>
	  <t id="320">{20005,9023}(Desecrated Skies)</t>
	  <t id="321">Ravaged by conflict, greed, and now the Xenon; this sector remains in turmoil. The internal power-struggles between pirate factions meant that travelling through the sector was extremely dangerous. The Paranid's attempts to cleanse the sector were frequent and forceful but the pirates always returned. \n\nJust prior to the Shutdown The Beryll were rumoured to have started supporting one of the pirate factions which are likely where the local Xenon originated from.</t>
	  <t id="330">{20005,3037}(Perdition's End)</t>
	  <t id="331">Perdition's flames brought fear to the hearts of both Argon and Paranid, and fury and rage from both sides have quenched the firestorm that burned through this sector. \n\nPerdition's end may soon be near, but the fires of conquest still burn brightly.</t>
	  <t id="340">{20202,901} {20001,201} {20401,4}(Kha'ak Sector Delta)</t>

	  <t id="350">{20005,7043}(Titania)</t>
	  <t id="351">Situated in close proximity to Uranus's largest moon, Titania, this sector was the primary base for the AGI Task Force prior to their merger into the wider Terran Protectorate. Now operating under the banner of the Intervention Corps, Titania has once again been built to deal with every operation or contingency which the Corps may have to commit to as part of their operational scope. \n\nDespite the organization's new name, Titania retains many of the old ATF landmark stations like the Military Flight School and the Central Intelligence Service which acts as an isolated branch of the Terran Secret Service despite the restructuring that was demanded after the Torus Aeternal was destroyed. \n\nDue Titania's close proximity to the Neptune gate it is believe that much of the protection and security of Outer Sol is organized here and following the recent rumors of Yaki involvement with the Pioneers, many have openly advocated for the return of ATF proper.</t>
	  <t id="360">{20005,3020}(Xaar's Belt)</t>
	  <t id="361">Following the reconnection of both Clarity's End and Perdition's End, Godrealm of the Paranid sent scouts to delve deeper into the new unknown and found this previously unidentified sector, believing it to be a sign from the holy three-dimensionality and immediately dispatched ships to establish three sets of superhighways.</t>
	  <t id="370">{20005,3020} {20402,1}(Xaar's Belt I)</t>
	  <t id="371">Situated between the planet's two moons, Xaar's Belt I is rich in methane and acts as the anchor in the superhighway connections as the scouts identified the, at the time, inactive gate which now connects to the Xenon ravaged Desecrated Skies.</t>
	  <t id="380">{20005,3020} {20402,2}(Xaar's Belt II)</t>
	  <t id="381">The sector's asteroid belt is the result of the second moon's slow decay caused by the planet's gravity pulling it down, which ultimately will result in the moon's impact of the planet and destruction of any potential planetary colony.</t>
	  <t id="390">{20005,3020} {20402,3}(Xaar's Belt III)</t>
	  <t id="391">When the Paranid scouts first entered the system via the Clarity's End gate they were met with the brilliance of the local sun's blue corona and began surveying the first moon while venturing deeper into the system, probing for any other potential gates before they made unexpected contact with another team of Paranid scouts who arrived via the Perdition's End gate.</t>
	  <t id="400">{20005,9003}(The Shallows)</t>
	  <t id="401">Originally deemed to be impossible to settle due to deeply drifting nebulae; The Shallows remained largely unpopulated. With recent solar flares having helped to clear the nebulae, building had continued at a greater pace. Both Boron and Split forces contested the area, eager to regain lost ground. \n\nDuring the Shutdown this sector was one of few known to have not regressed due to the dominating presence of the Strong Arms corporation and is directly connected to the "Enduring Shores" Boron sectors. \n\nThe Shallows stands as the crossroads against the Atreus Corporation and host to numerous skirmishes during the long isolation. Originally the over zealous Strong Arms conducted an invasion of Queen's Retribution while orbital assets were being evacuated and while the assault succeeded in ravaging the remaining Boron miltiary, it was equally destructive on the Split and led to neither side having the advantage over the other.</t>
	  <t id="410">{20005,5044}(Family Than)</t>
	  <t id="411">The seat of political power for the Split within the "Warlord's Dominion". Prior to the Shutdown, Patriarch Than was simply the director of the Strong Arms corporation but following this he seized power in the now completely cutoff Split sectors which now included this previously unknown sector. \n\nWhile all real power was still centered within Thyn's Excavation via the Strong Arms Corporation, Patriarch Than was eager to further validate his new title and laid claim to the entire system. However following reconnection to the Network and under the threats of Patriach Zyarth, Patriach Than fell in line and, officially, is subservient to Zyarth. In reality the Strong Arms Corporation still has completely authority within the "Warlord's Dominion".</t>
	  <t id="420">{20005,5044} {20402,1}(Family Than I)</t>
	  <t id="421">The capital of Family Than and political seat of power within the "Warlord's Dominion", this sector is arguably the second most important Split sector because of the crucial ore mined from the asteroid belt. \n\nOnce reconnected to the Gate Network, Patriarch Zyarth demanded Family Than yield to his authority or risk the same fate as the formally Free Families. While officially subservient, Patriach Than is still the director of the Strong Arms Corporation and has refused to degrade his status.</t>
	  <t id="430">{20005,5044} {20402,3}(Family Than III)</t>
	  <t id="431">Pushed further out from the planet's orbit, Family Than III is the location of a previously inactive gate which has only very recently reconnected to the wider Network via Unholy Descent and by extension, the zealots of the Holy Order of the Pontifex. \n\nThe sole source of ore for the Split within the "Warlord's Dominion", this system is very busy with industrial ships traversing acrossing the sector to keep the ever demanding Strong Arm war machine running.</t>
	  <t id="440">{20005,5005}(Thyn's Abyss)</t>
	  <t id="441">This deep space system was about as close as the Split got to a civilian operation and once produced food and other organic products while mines on the asteroids spread across the system. Due to the lack of any real military presence the sector was quickly overwhelmed by Xenon forces before they withdrew back to Matrix #472D just before the Great Shutdown.</t>
	  <t id="450">{20005,5034}(Thyn's Excavation)</t>
	  <t id="451">The location of the Stong Arms Headquarters, Thyn's Excavation provided funds and resources for the ongoing conflict in the local area against not just the nearby Boron but across the entire old Network and continues to be very well guarded by the aptly named corporation. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown, Strong Arms took complete control of the local Split sectors in what became known as the "Warlord's Dominion" ruled by the self appointed Patriarch Than, the director the Strong Arms Corporation.</t>
	  <t id="460">{20005,9008}(Blue Horizon)</t>
	  <t id="461">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector was officially designated US 18-16 and was the location of a disappointing mineral survey conducted by the Boron Royal Research Institute. Despite the poor results efforts continued to probe the sector for anything of value as it was reconnected to the "Enduring Shores" of the Atreus Corporation who deployed their only Superhighway following a review of the previous survey and the discovery that the results were intentionally fabricated for unknown purposes and obscured the fact that the sector was extremely mineral rich. \n\nHome to most of what was the "Enduring Shores" mining operations, Blue Horizon is as critical as ever against the local Split and Xenon threat.</t>
	  <t id="470">{20005,9008} {20402,1}(Blue Horizon I)</t>
	  <t id="471">The original core of the sector, Blue Horizon I is where the erroneous survey was conducted which stated that the sector was devoid of mineral value despite the presense of a significant asteroid field. \n\nAs such, Blue Horizon I is a vital source of ore for the Atreus Corporation's operation in the "Enduring Shores" and is generally well guarded against any potential Split incursion from the "Warlord's Dominion".</t>
	  <t id="480">{20005,9008} {20402,4}(Blue Horizon IV)</t>
	  <t id="481">Settled as a result of the Atreus Corporation's construction of the Superhighway, Blue Horizon IV is abundant in both methane and silicon, further proof that the Boron Royal Research Institue's mineral survey was a complete lie. \n\nSituated further in to the Blue Horizon sector, it is less guarded than its companion and is directly connected to Queen's Harbour. However following the recent reconnection to the Network and the previously inactive gate to Great Trench now online and showing concerning signs of Xenon, the Atreus Corporation has begun to divert newly supplied Queendom military assets to better protect this vital system.</t>
	  <t id="490">{20005,2007}(Great Trench)</t>
	  <t id="491">This Boron mining colony was once a busy hub of both industry and as a refit and supply center for Boron ships working in the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids made the Boron who lived here harder and more cynical than those in the home systems, \n\nOnce isolated, the colony very quickly fell apart as they were unable to produce their own food and quickly burned through any stockpiles they had gathered.</t>
	  <t id="500">{20005,2017}(Queen's Harbour)</t>
	  <t id="501">Once specialising in food and power storage technology, Queen's Harbour is the location of the original Atreus Headquarters that was lost when the Gates began to shut down. While the remnants of the corporation reestablished themselves in Ocean of Fantasy before collapsing under the stewartship of the Provinces Adrift, Atreus proper became the driving force in the "Enduring Shores" of Queen's Harbour, Queen's Retribution, and the formally colonized Blue Horizon. \n\nNow that connection has been reestablished these sectors immediately rejoined the Queendom but are still formally run by the Atreus Corporation due to the vast distance between them and Kingdom's End.</t>
	  <t id="510">{20005,2018}(Queen's Retribution)</t>
	  <t id="511">Formally a Boron core sector specialising in technological and military output, Queen's Retribution was established to strike out against a growing conflict with the Split. During the Great Shutdown the new Boron colonies were completely disconnected from the wider network and instead were locked into a bitter conflict with the equally trapped "Warlord's Dominion" Split. \n\nWhile originally the home of the local Boron Shipyard, Queen's Retribution found itself now on the frontline in the local conflict. As such, all vital infrastructure was moved to the more secure Queen's Harbour and brought completely under the control of the Atreus Corporation.</t>

	  <t id="521">Once a Split mining outpost, one day a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by the Argon security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a radioactive hell and access to the system was restricted. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon superweapon was to blame. \n\nPrior to the Shutdown pilots who passed through this system once reported a large ship but those reports ceased and if the ship existed, its presence and location was never known and the Xenon presence in the system has only further increased following The Collapse.</t>

Blue Profit was most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Teladi factory workers which combined Teladi reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Argon and Teladi percussion instruments. "Teladi Blues" is still appreciated by many sentient species post-Shutdown. \n\nNow the sector's space remains silent, the economy having completely collapsed and nearly every ship no longer spaceworthy.</t>

	  <t id="611">A vast and cold expanse, heavily fortified and dominated by the local Xenon, Matrix #483 was only recently discovered yet has clearly been inhabited by the Xenon for quite some time. Every aspect of the environment appears to have bene meticulously controlled, its clinical perfection masks a cold and unfeeling order. To venture into this sector is to navigate a world where every action is monitored and every mistake is harshly punished.</t>
	  <t id="620">{20005,6048}(The Vault)</t>
	  <t id="621">While the Teladi Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector would have choosen to disagree. The Vault was a system hard to reach by normal means and contained nothing but high tech stations. \n\nHome to the Teladi Company's main research facility and it always tried to improve upon existing technology. While expected to expand and greatly improve the Company's assets, The Vault was lost to the Shutdown and all hopes and aspirations were lost with it when the colonists were unable to sustain their own survival.</t>

	  <t id="700">{20005,9022}(Danna's Chance)</t>
	  <t id="701">This lawless system was the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants had made a fortune trading the illicit goods while many more were not so fortunate. \n\nDuring The Shutdown it would seem those local pirates banded together and became quite a formidable organization which kept a firm grip on control and managing the resources which were available. Since reconnection they accepted an invitation to join the Scale Plate Pact and have since received significant economic boost to their operations.</t>
	  <t id="710">{20005,1034}(Legend's Home)</t>
	  <t id="711">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector simply did not exist on navigation systems with any rumors ruthlessly squashed until OTAS was ready for the sector to be made public. A center for high tech research and development, Legend's Home is the beating heart of OTAS's power. \n\nAs the gates began to flicker, OTAS launched an invasion into the neighbouring sector of Akeela's Beacon after a dispute over financial bureaucracy would see the government's support of OTAS dwindle substantial. However, once the Great Shutdown began and OTAS was thrown into the dark they returned to their roots, albeit with significantly reduced wages, and are now even more technologically advanced than they have ever been.</t>
	  <t id="720">{20005,6041}(Merchant Haven)</t>
	  <t id="721">Merchant Haven was established to be a major trade port for the new Teladi expansion campaign, however plans failed when surprise attacks by hostile pirate forces stopped their advance into the nearby systems. The sector then served the local Teladi population and traded with the nearby Argon and Split. \n\nFollowing its reconnection, Merchant Haven found itself in a very advantageous position in the Teladi's largest block of sectors.</t>
	  <t id="730">{20005,1024}(Akeela's Beacon)</t>
	  <t id="731">The four great stars which grace this sector were created following the tragic but noble sacrifice of Akeela Hartnell. Her last will was for the Argon Federation to govern the new system and make it a safe haven for all traders. \n\nHowever, this dream was crushed shortly before the Great Shutdown when the OTAS corporation invaded and occupied the system to deprive the remaining Argon colonies of vital sources of energy. Initially this occupation was justified as a necessary step towards securing the well-being of the system's population but post-Shutdown OTAS reinforced their presence in the sector, developing it into a proper first line of defence should anyone, or anything, attempt to attack Legend's Home.</t>
	  <t id="740">{20005,1025}(Aladna Hill)</t>
	  <t id="741">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war, Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. Following the OTAS invasion of Akeela's Beacon the Argon Federation began to amass military assets with the goal of reclaiming the system and bring the corporation to justice. \n\nPost-Shutdown these military assets were used to keep law and order both in Aladna Hill and neighbouring Light of Heart. As such, when they reconnected to the Network they were swiftly reintegrate into the Argon Federation.</t>
	  <t id="750">{20005,1035}(Light of Heart)</t>
	  <t id="751">Once the source of ships and equipment for the Argon settlements claimed following the conclussion of the last Xenon war. Following the OTAS invasion of Akeela's Beacon all efforts were made to building military assets for the counterattack. Unfortunately the Great Shutdown began before this planned attack was initiated which left a significant portion of the Argon Navy stranded in both Light of Heart and Aladna Hill. \n\nDuring this period of isolation Light of Heart changed from being a source of military assets and instead became the heart of trade and commerce with the substantial military ships keeping a firm grip on law and order. Once reconnected this pivot proved especially benefitial as Light of Heart became a key trade route in the Network's new orientation.</t>
	  <t id="760">{20005,1037}(Montalaar)</t>
	  <t id="761">An old mining outpost founded near the red gas giant "Hitt's Eye", Montalaar had been an Argon settlement in the areas of space claimed following the Xenon conflict. \n\nTrading, food, and materials installations had been constructed in service to the private mining outfits looking to exploit new minerals but following the Shutdown these facilities were slowly decommissioned to keep the orbital station host to a small colony from falling apart. Now that the sector is reconnected, survivors have begun to be relocated across the Federation and the reintegrate of the sector has begun.</t>
	  <t id="770">{20005,6042}(Mines of Fortune)</t>
	  <t id="771">Once the largest Teladi mining operation in history following the Teladi discovering and retrofitting abandoned space stations set into mineral-rich asteroids. The vast richness of the sector would be of no consolation to those left behind following its complete isolation as there was no infrastructure in place to refine the raw ore and silicon into useable products. It appears that the entire sector collapsed, unable to provide power and food to the doomed residents. \n\nCuriously the previously retrofitted mining stations are absent from the sector, their fates unknown.</t>
	  <t id="780">{20005,5037}(Zyarth's Stand)</t>
	  <t id="781">Originally little more than a desolate fallback for Family Zyarth once they had been cut off and trapped behind the Xenon, Zyarth's Stand became home to a Split Equipment Dock and the remaining Zyarth forces prior to the Great Shutdown yet even these gates immediately began to flickering following Family Zyarth's total assault against the Xenon. Now reconnected to Zyarth's Dominion, Patriarch Zyarth is eager to reclaim the system and fully integrate it into his new empire.</t>
	  <t id="790">{20005,5039}(Patriarch's Conclusion)</t>
	  <t id="791">Once one of the Split's most remote core sectors with a moderate output of agricultural products. Military operations here served as the base for the building conflict in nearby sectors due to the ever increasing tensions with the Boron which finally escalated to outright war following the Great Shutdown. \n\nFollowing its reconnection, Zyarth scouts discovered that all orbital assets had been destroyed as the result of some undocumented war. Worse yet there was no evidence of any Boron wreckage or losses in the conflict which was either the result of sheer overwhelming numbers or the failings of these clearly disgraceful Split.</t>
	  <t id="800">{20005,1030}(Elena's Fortune)</t>
	  <t id="801">After the Kha'ak attack on President's End the decision was made to bolster the defense of the Argon home systems. The Kha'ak's attack had decimated the pirate forces and allowed the sector to be reclaimed and fortified. Once the system's gates deactivated all of the Federation's plans fell apart and the sector quickly fell back into anarchy and disorder.</t>
	  <t id="810">{20005,1039}(Nyana's Hideout)</t>
	  <t id="811">Named after the Argon heroine and Goner priestess Nyana Gunne, great-grandaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. Prior to the Great Shutdown the sector had fallen on hard times, hardening the people which served them well in the isolation. Following the Gates' reactivating, Nyana's Hideout connected to the still isolated Argon sectors near the newly formed empire of Patriarch Zyarth and became a shelter for refugees fleeing the frequent slaver raids.</t>
	  <t id="820">{20005,1033}(Interworlds)</t>
	  <t id="821">Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food to the rest of the Argon Federation, Interworlds expanded to include more high tech stations and products. Once home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, they were not present in the system during the Great Shutdown. What did remain was unable to maintain the stations and slowly they were decommissioned to maintain the supply of food.</t>
	  <t id="830">{20005,1048}(Wastelands)</t>
	  <t id="831">Once named Light of Hope until the Xenon attacked many years ago and it was clear that the patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using whatever transport ships were available. A large force of four Titan class Destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with full fighter wings were dispatched to escort the fleeing transports but were overwhelmed by a Xenon fleet with only the civilian ships and a lone destroyer, the Challenger, escaping.\n\nThree years later a joint Argon-Boron force reclaimed the sector and recolonization began. Unfortunately the Great Shutdown once again thwarted this sector's progress and what had been established has fallen into complete disrepair and the surviving colonists eking out a meager existence.</t>
	  <t id="840">{20005,5021}(Ghinn's Escape)</t>
	  <t id="841">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further into the area it once connected to, this Split colony was once heavily guarded and a large manufacturer of surveillance equipment and defensive weapons allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. Members of both Families Tkr and Njy were often found in this sector given its close proximity to their space and even saw some skirmishes between them following Family Njy's invasion and occupation of Family Tkr's territory as a result of the Dragon Incident. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown this colony completely collapsed and was entirely isolated for decades. The surviving Split families are only just now learning of Patriarch Zyarth's aggression while the sector itself has become a hub for the Fallen Families as they have bolster their ranks with the inhabitants of Ghinn's Escape.</t>

	  <t id="911">Pre-Shutdown the Teladi had been expanding their influence into the sector with aspirations to take control from the local pirates but were met with fierce resistence which only led to an even more protracted conflict. Now that the gates have reactivated Teladi scouts have so far only found the debris of both Teladi and pirate forces along with the shattered remains of old stations with uncomfirmed reports that the other gate is also active.</t>
	  <t id="920">{20005,9006}(Shadow's End)</t>
	  <t id="921">A previously hidden sector locked behind the OTAS Headquarters of Legend's Home, this sector has since come into its own during the Great Shutdown. Despite the close proximity and abundance of mineral resources, this was the last sector to be incorporated into the OTAS Corporation's holdings as it was not a threat to their security and no local facilities were required. \n\nSince being added, OTAS has expanded their exploitation of the rich resources to fuel their ever growing demand and infrastructure developments while also relocating several high-tech facilities.</t>
	  <t id="930">{20005,3014}(Tebathimanckatt's Legacy)</t>
	  <t id="931">A dim, unpopulated sector along the Paranid border region, Tebathimanckatt's Legacy saw only cursory resource surveys when its jumpgate connection opened from Pious Mists IV, with the Godrealm being preoccupied with reconsolidating its holdings as the gate system began to awaken. This attitude changed following the discovery of the breakaway Holy Order and their heretic Pontifex, which coincided with a flurry of rumors that the sector's name was more than symbolic and that hidden somewhere within were artifacts of great power once held by Admiral Tebathimanckatt himself. \n\nThough these artifacts never materialized despite an intense search by private citizens and Godrealm-affiliated forces alike, the discovery of the jumpgate connecting to Perpetual Sin III saw the system's status skyrocket from quiet Godrealm backwater to a critical strategic avenue and second war front. Forming a potential path to strike at their enemy's interior regions, achieving military control over the sector became a high priority for both factions.</t>
	  <t id="940">{20005,3046}(Untainted Eternity)</t>
	  <t id="941">Situated above the accretion disc of a black hole - this sector is completely unkown and new to the Gate Network, unspoiled by centuries of conflict. \n\nCuriously, and troubling to many, the time dilation expected from such close proximity to a black hole is not observed here and even more concerning signals are somehow being emitted from within the black hole, which should be impossible.</t>
	  <t id="950">{20005,1011}(Belt of Aguilar)</t>
	  <t id="951">Founded shortly after the first Kha'ak invasions, as a support outpost for the nearby colonies, Belt of Aguilar has had a short but turbulent history. With the rise of the newly relocated Jonferco, this sector initially enjoyed good prospects as it housed the only gate to the newly discovered Albion system; which was a playground for corporations to test new technologies and extract the vast mineral riches. \n\nHowever, following the destruction of the original Jonferco Headquarters and the shutdown of the Albion gate, the sector's future became uncertain. during the Great Shutdown what was left on the Jonferco corporation began to rebuild and retun to their roots while efforts have been made in attempting to reactivate the Albion gate.</t>

	  <t id="981">Identified as a heavily entrenched Xenon sector prior to the shutdown, #695 was barely explored due to the extreme risk to pilots and the data corruption of remote drones. While it once was believed to be a core sector; #695 was clearly severed from the wider Xenon network prior to its recent reconnection.</t>

In the years since the Shutdown all orbital assets have completely fallen apart and the solar output plummeted to nearly zero.</t>
