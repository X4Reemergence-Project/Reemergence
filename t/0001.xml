	  <t id="1300">Xaar's Faithful </t>
	  <t id="1301">XAAR</t>
	  <t id="1302">Cut off from the Empire's leadership, and with much of the local religious structure lost in a freak navigational accident, the Paranid inhabitants of Wretched Skies spent much of the Shutdown building an unusual bond of blood with their Split neighbors through constant violent clashes. \n\nStrangely, the influence of the Split had something of a stabilizing effect on these leaderless Paranid; rather than descending into madness or despondence, the Paranid of Wretched Skies rallied around a new doctrine that combined scattered elements of the traditional Paranid mythos with the brutal tenets of Split culture. Once the Gates reopened, this earned them the respect of the Split Patriarch, but also the enmity of both the Godrealm and the Holy Order, a position which is held mutually by the Faithful. Unlike the Holy Order, they are much less concerned about the heresies of the "lesser races" and maintain generally nonhostile, if somewhat chilly, relationships with most other Commonwealth powers. \n\nThe fanatical beliefs of Xaar's Faithful are simple, straightforward, and impossibly heretical to the larger Paranid factions. According to the Faithful, the continued absence of Paranid Prime from the known Gate Network is no mere accident. They hold that the Priest-Emperor has shrouded the system from sight, biding his time in the darkness between the stars as a trial laid upon all Paranid, and that he someday will return to lead the Paranid people once more: embracing those who remained devoted, rewarding those who took up arms in his name, and cleansing all apostates with holy fire. As was decreed fitting of their position as subservient to the Priest-Emperor, no Paranid of Xaar's Faithful may hold a title above Deacon, and thus Xaarist affairs are generally directed by the "Deacon Triumvirate" - a triplet of councils representing the dogmatic pillars of Belief in Xaar, Force of Arms, and Mundanity of Life.</t>

	  <t id="2902">The Optimised Technology, Armaments and Shielding Corporation, commonly known as OTAS, is a omnicorporation specialized in the design and manufacture of advanced spaceships heaquartered in Legend's Home. In the pre-Shutdown era, OTAS technologies and ships were highly advanced, often leading the cutting edge of Commonwealth scientific advancement, granting the corporation a prominent position on the political starscape of the old Commonweath of Planets.\n\nJust prior to the Great Collapse, OTAS launched an attack on Akeela's Beacon in an escalatory response to the passing of certain industry regulations by the Argon Federation. Seen as an act of terrorism by the Argon, the resulting Argon military response was cut short by Gate Shutdown. While the exact history of the period is lost to the chaos of the Great Dark, it is clear that the Argon response failed to bring OTAS to heel and the corporation now holds full administrative and military control of the formerly Argon sectors in their local region. \n\nHaving evolved beyond a simple technologies corporation, the massive OTAS commercial enterprise now operates as a fully independent star nation. Featuring locally appointed representatives from each controlled sector sitting on the board of directors and a functional state apparatus that earns generally favourable public sentiment, any scars of the hostile takeover have seemingly faded from memory.</t>

	  <t id="10">Planet 9</t>
	  <t id="11">Following reports of unknown vessels and sporadic disappearances in the outer Oort Cloud, the Protectorate reactivated the trans-orbital accelerator leading to the secretive "Planet 9" and established a sentry presence. Generally considered to be the edge of Terran-controlled Sol, Planet 9 is chiefly remarkable for being the sector where Beryll Syndicate operations in Terran space were finally cornered and hunted to extinction, and is officially home to little more than the occasional patrol or intrepid prospector. However, the increase in traffic accompanying the reactivation of the accelerator has led to an uptick in unknown vessel sightings, and rumours abound that the Protectorate is preparing a major military operation to establish a permanent presence and ensure that any survivors of the Beryll purge or whatever else may be lurking out in the dark are destroyed for good.</t>

	  <t id="21">A previously identified Xenon Core sector, Matrix #23 was a hub for communications protocol handling and re-coding of the onboard ship A.I. Matrix #23 was believed to have been the original source of many of the Xenon's latest additions to their already lethal arsenal like the old pre-Branch 9 LX, PX, and Q designs while also widely believed to be the source of the original I battleship. According to the survivors of Althes and Megnir these local Xenon continued to further refine and develop these ships up until the moment of reconnection where suddenly all pre-Branch 9 designs ceased all function and a rapid evolution began.\n\nIt is speculated that the Branch-9 Xenon quickly either subsumed or destroyed their more archaic brethren. There are also reports of a strange new Xenon construct emanating unidentifiable signals out into the Network following a cataclysmic detonation on the planet's surface.</t>

	  <t id="31">Established due to a change in Protectorate doctrine focused on increasing Sol's strategic depth and resilience, this sector encompasses a resource-rich region created by the orbital degradation of Phobos and bolstered through active asteroid capture from the Asteroid Belt conducted by deepspace expeditions ranging well outside the established Asteroid Belt sector. Previously overlooked due to the richness of Asteroid Belt, the increasing pressure on that sector as the first line of defense against hostile incursion has led the Protectorate to seek alternative concentrations of raw resources in the event that access to Outer Sol is lost.</t>

	  <t id="41">Another resource extraction sector established following a shift in Protectorate defensive doctrine, this sector is much closer to the small planet and contains a large silicon-rich debris field. This field is the result of a controversial program of capturing potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and trans-solar objects and directing them into close proximity with Mercury, where they are broken up by gravitational interaction with Sol itself and settle into a close orbit. \n\nThe long-running program, first initiated to protect Earth from potential impactors, has drawn heavy and continuous criticism for the dangers that the debris field and transiting captured bodies pose to the crucial energy cell production facilities of the Mercury sector. Nonetheless, the Protectorate's insistence on maintaining the program has over time built up a massive quantity of raw material both in the regional space and fallen to the planet's surface, which now provides an important strategic reserve in the otherwise resource-poor Inner Sol region.</t>
	  <t id="50">{20005,7005}(Althes)</t>
	  <t id="51">One of the several Terran Lost Colonies, Althes once formed the gateway between Sol and her other colonies. Connected to Sol via a Terran-constructed gate in the Neptune sector, Althes provided further access to the other lost colonies of Megnir, Segaris, and eventually Aldrin. When the gates shut down, Althes remained connected to neighboring Megnir through one gate, while another realigned with a Xenon Core Matrix, plunging the two colonies into a bitter war for survival with the equally isolated Xenon Matrix. The reconnection of the gates brought little relief, as the isolated Matrix synchronized with the rest of Branch-9 and evolved far past its previous capabilities, forcing the beleaguered colonists to withdraw to Megnir or face complete destruction.\n\nSince this bleak retreat the Protectorate has reestablished the Althes-Neptune connection and has begun to occupy the system, rejecting all requests from the Pioneers to release the system into their authority.</t>
	  <t id="60">{20005,7006}(Megnir)</t>
	  <t id="61">Another colony once thought to have been lost, the initial rediscovery of Megnir, followed by Segaris and Aldrin, were momentous occasions subsequently cut short by the Gate Shutdown. Remaining connected to neighbouring Althes, Megnir found itself fighting desperately against the Xenon advance alongside her sister colony during the Isolation. Though the brunt of the fighting was borne by Althes, Megnir supplied much of the men and materiel, with the colonies understanding that this was a do or die moment for both of them. It was thanks to Megnir's shipyard - initially built by the Sol government, heavily used during the Isolation, and decommissioned following induction into the Pioneers Initiative due to the immense amount of accumulated wear and tear - that the colonies were able to avoid total destruction after the loss of Althes.\n\nContact with the colony was restored when a Gate reopened and connected the two-colonies-turned-one to the third colony of Segaris, now under the flag of the Segaris Pioneers. Though Megnir was initially slated for absorption into the Protectorate itself, the Pioneers successfully made the case that the Colonies had stood together before, and deserved the right to stand together again. However, the Protectorate has refused to relinquish control over Althes citing the Xenon threat and its new, deliberate, connection to Neptune following the closure of the Brennan's Triumph gate.</t>
	  <t id="70">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,4}{20404,8}(Matrix #48)</t>
	  <t id="71">Connected to a major Xenon sector identified as Matrix #23, the Xenon of this sector were the scourge of the Lost Colonies during the Gate Shutdown. When the gate connections began to fail, the Xenon moved extensive assets into both Matrix #23 and Matrix #48 apparently foreseeing the need for the Matrixes to stand alone.\n\nRemaining connected to Althes and Megnir while isolated, the local Xenon fought a deadly and protracted conflict against the neighbouring Terran Colonies, making slow but steady progress against the desperate defenders. The reopening of the gates allowed both Matrix #23 and Matrix #48 to resynchronize with the Branch-9 network, catapulting its technological evolution overnight and enabling it to completely force the Terran defenders out of Althes. Though stopped at the Megnir-Althes Gate by the spirited defense of the colonists and later pushed further back by a considerable Terran Intervention Corps force. Matrix #48 remains a persistent lurking threat and source of continuing concern for both the Terran Protectorate and Segaris Pioneers.</t>

	  <t id="81">Even more of an enigma than Matrix #79B, this sector mirrors all of the complete unknowns as its counterpart and is confirmed to have also never been encountered before in the network. The Alliance of the Word conducted further research into the structures and discovered that the ones here pre-date those in Matrix #79B yet gave no insights as to their origin or purpose.</t>
	  <t id="90">{20005,1041}(Power Circle)</t>
	  <t id="91">Sometime before the last Xenon conflict the planet "Shipfall" was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Argon industrial colony. Some effort had been made to re-establish the colony, but had been restricted to mining and agriculture. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the sector once again fell apart as it was unable to support itself and there are currently no identified inhabitants.</t>
	  <t id="100">{20005,1041} {20402,1}(Power Circle I)</t>
	  <t id="101">Once the initial area of space utilized pre-Shutdown, now that Power Circle is again connected to the Argon, albeit the Antigone Republic now. As the Republic was already founded by colonist who overcame great adversities and became a thriving nation there are already many plans to not just reclaim the system but properly recolonize it.</t>
	  <t id="110">{20005,1041} {20402,5}(Power Circle V)</t>
	  <t id="111">Prior to the Shutdown the Federation completed the local superhighway leading much closer to the surface of the planet "Shipfall" so the fledgling new settlements could be better resupplied. Immense effort was taken to relocate the Gate which once connected to Three Worlds as well to give the venture every opportunity of success. Sadly now it seems that effort was completely wasted as not only did the colony completely die out but now that Gate connects to the enigmatic Matrix #79A and #79B.</t>
	  <t id="120">{20005,6012}(Teladi Gain)</t>
	  <t id="121">The favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector came under Teladi management who reimagined it into a destination of recreation. The Bliss Place produced the narcotic spaceweed which drew in dreamers, artists, and neo-philosophers of all races. \n\nDuring the Shutdown the sector's priorities dramatically shifted and the leisures of recreation were quickly abandoned for the harsh reality of survival. Now reconnected, the Teladi are once again set on restoring the sector to its pre-Shutdown condition.</t>
	  <t id="130">{20005,1032}(Herron's Nebula)</t>
	  <t id="131">A mineral rich system famed across the Network for its residents' vast consumption of spacefuel and the semi-legal bootlegging which procured it. Herron’s Nebula was fortunate enough to remain connected to Argon Prime during most of the Shutdown, having its connection lost only a few years ago. Thankfully, the Gate immediately connected to a fellow Argon Sector, Elena's Fortune, which became a boone to both sectors.\n\nNow that the sector is once again connected to the wider Argon Federation it has been shifted outward and is on the periphery. Perhaps because of this there has been a recent influx of “prospectors” from the Hatikvah Free League who have taken a great interest in the locals continual demand for the now very illegal and restricted spacefuel.</t>
	  <t id="140">{20005,1012}(Three Worlds)</t>
	  <t id="141">Once on the border of Argon and Boron space the populated planets of this system were popular vacation destinations for the Argon high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings where the very best of Argon cuisine was available. When the Gates began to shutdown the sector saw a mass exodus of this society leaving behind only the less fortunate and workers; however, due to the excessive amount of food production in the sector they not only survived but are one of the few populations to grow and thrive.\n\nNow reconnected to the wider network the Antigone Republic formally annexed the sector following a widely supported referendum.</t>

	  <t id="151">Despite being another newly discovered system, Matrix #714 shows clear signs of long term Xenon occupation with them even constructing structures on the planet's surface. While the purpose of these structures is unknown, the Xenon typically built them after establishing orbital ship production facilities.\n\nThere are still others within the Alliance of the Word who suggest that this order is reversed and instead that the structures come first and are then followed by orbital infrastructure. Regardless, Matrix #714 dominates this region of the Network, producing a steady stream of warships to fuel the fires of Thark's Cascade.</t>
	  <t id="160">{20005,2004}(Dark Waters)</t>
	  <t id="161">This system was rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. Heavily policed, any potentially hostile would be swiftly destroyed despite the sector itself being little more than a trading outpost. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the entire sector was evacuated to the still connected nearby Boron sectors.</t>
	  <t id="170">{20005,2015}(Mists of Elysium)</t>
	  <t id="171">The planet Elysium is described as a peaceful paradise world filled with lush plant life but with lowlands filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day yet the Boron were unconcerned by this as they remained within their deep-sea homes. \n\nNow reconnected, no Boron could be found on the planet and the thick mist has extended to covering the seas as well.</t>
	  <t id="180">{20005,2005}(Depths of Silence)</t>
	  <t id="181">The heavily guarded secret of Dark Waters, Depths of Silence was formerly home to a massive scientific black site established by the Royal Boron Military to pioneer new technologies that could give the Boron people any advantage over their enemies. \n\nOnce filled with sprawling, high-tech complexes that investigated everything from creating advanced ion-hybrid weaponry to increasing the nutrient density of BoFu, the sector is now completely devoid of all signs of life. What became of the heavy security force and the research they protected remains unknown.</t>
	  <t id="190">{20005,2010}(Light Waters)</t>
	  <t id="191">Following the discovery of the North gate in Shore of Infinity, this sector was founded and colonized by the Boron. Once a mixture of food production and solar power plants, the system grew to importance to the nearby colonies. The habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size with the surface being mostly covered in water. \n\nFollowing the shutdown the local Boron retreated deep into the planet's vast ocean and abandoned the stations which fell into disrepair before ultimately burning up in the atmosphere.</t>
	  <t id="200">{20005,2025}(Shining Currents)</t>
	  <t id="201">Founded as a food production center to aid the continual growth of the Boron Queendom, the name comes from the reflection of mercury from the ocean of the primary planet's moon. \n\nAs the Gates began to flicker off the Boron evacuated from Dark Waters took refuge here but they seem to have not survived the Great Collapse.</t>
	  <t id="210">{20005,2026}(Shore of Infinity)</t>
	  <t id="211">Leased by the Paranid to the Boron who once had a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants, Shore of Infinity saw limited trade between the two races and helped keep relations between them amicable. While the Paranid provided protection, the Boron lent their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranids' efforts in cyber biology. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown the sector became one of the few surviving Boron colonies, albeit just barely. Those Paranid that remained became erratic being cut off from their leaders and left in an ill-fated exodus.</t>
	  <t id="220">{20005,2020}(Reservoir of Tranquillity)</t>
	  <t id="221">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system was a source of strategic power for the Boron. Once a border colony to a local Split family, it acted as a crossroads for the nearby Boron settlements which made it particularly important for passing traders. Guarded by a lone destroyer and escorts, pirate activity was minimal and the Split had been occupied elsewhere. \n\nOnce reconnected the Alliance of the Word found a few scattered Split wrecks and salvaged them for information, but unfortunately there was little of value other than the markings of Family Rhy. Surprisingly, there was still a small population of Boron remaining as they had retreated deep into the oceans to escape the rapidly encroaching ice age engulfing the planet.</t>
	  <t id="230">{20005,3026}(Duke's Domain)</t>
	  <t id="231">Once a highly agriculturally developed system, Duke's Domain provided much of the Soja Beans forming the basis of the Paranid diet. The highly ionised water of the system's planet contains rare organic minerals which greatly improve the flavour of beans nurtured in it. During the last Xenon conflict, this system suffered particularly heavy losses due to its location in the heart of the old Paranid Empire. Following this traumatic event a moment began to militarize the system which, at the time, failed to gain enough support. Once the Jump Gate network began to shut down however, this local movement took control and acted on those ambitions.\n\nDuke's Domain is unique in that it is the only system to have approached the Holy Order and requested to hear the Pontifex's teachings. Because of this, and the significant military assets, Duke's Domain has grown into a stronghold for the Holy Order.</t>
	  <t id="240">{20005,3038}(Perpetual Sin)</t>
	  <t id="241">For a long time an insignificant system seeing only occasional Kha'ak skirmishes, it grew to being proof that those considered to be beyond redemption can be brought back onto the path. On the third day, of the third month, after having fallen into disgrace and being banished here, a Paranid scout managed to triangulate the location of a jumpgate leading to a then-unknown system. \n\nRegaining the respect of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, this scout was sent to explore the system but was never seen again. \n\nThe discovery of this active gate, in close proximity to the Second Duchy, was seen as further evidence that the Paranid Empire was destined for greatness and helped PerpetualSin itself to gain some favour.</t>
	  <t id="250">{20005,3038} {20402,1}(Perpetual Sin I)</t>
	  <t id="251">Once initially the original location of the Southern gate leading to Duke's Citadel prior to the Paranid moving it even further South. Perpetual Sin I was established to further study the gate of legend and prior to the shutdown Paranid scientists discovered yet another gate floating lifeless and in a decaying orbit at the very extreme edge of the solar system. While there are no indications of their success the trapped Paranid appear to have been making attempts to reactivate these gates.</t>
	  <t id="260">{20005,3038} {20402,3}(Perpetual Sin III)</t>
	  <t id="261">A refuge for the Paranid who wish to seek the same redemption as the fabled scout of old, Perpetual Sin III has been designated as the site of their ultimate potential salvation and is the only acceptable place for these banished Paranid to gather within the Holy Order without risk of being executed. \n\nAs has become tradition, on the third day, of the third month, of this third system; disgraced Paranid assemble to find either renewed purpose and redemption or further disgrace and damnation. Those who return to the holy path are given this singular chance and should they fail in their duties again will be executed on sight.</t>
	  <t id="270">{20005,3019}(Fierce Clarity)</t>
	  <t id="271">A newly discovered system, Fierce Clarity has been selected by the reclusive Pontifex of the Holy Order as a new holy site of the three-dimensionality and on the cusp of prophetic wonder. \n\nWhile the end goals of the Pontifex are unknown it is rumoured that the sector is to be built up to further support nearby Pontifex's Claim as it is on the frontline against the Godrealm. Yet another rumour is that the Holy Order had actually found something of immense value in the sector and are now trying to hide the truth.</t>
	  <t id="280">{20005,3041}(Pontifex' Seclusion)</t>
	  <t id="281">The last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors, this sector was famed for its lack of hospitality and said to be a retreat for the Pontifex should he need to leave the main sectors and be isolated for any reason. Once deep within the Second Duchy it was hard to reach due to the pirate activity along the way but following the reactivation it has since been absorbed into the Holy Order of the Pontifex.</t>
	  <t id="290">{20005,3045}(Unholy Descent)</t>
	  <t id="291">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonists of not following the Paranid religion. Now once again connected it appears Xhar'Bar claimed the lives of those heretical colonists, depriving the Holy Order the chance to purge them in the name of holy Pontifex Maximus Haereticus.</t>
	  <t id="300">{20005,9034}(Cathedral of Xaar)</t>
	  <t id="301">A system which had just been discovered and claimed by the Paranid prior to the beginning of the Collapse, Cathedral of Xaar was slated to become a far flung temple in service to the holy three-dimensionality. These ideas were dashed when the sector was once again thrown into the dark and those Paranid within driven to madness. Now unveiled once again, the Godrealm seeks to reinvigorate the plans of old and have consecrated it as a holy site once again.</t>
	  <t id="310">{20005,3023}(Clarity's End)</t>
	  <t id="311">Long-range scout patrols from Cardinal's Domain ventured upon this sector at the same time as the arrival of a mining expedition from Aladna Hill. The resulting tensions did little but reopen old wounds. Few Paranid would deny the opportunity to fan the flames of a war brought over from the old world. \n\nHaving now been reconnected to the Network via Cardinal's Domain, the Cardinal himself has issued orders to explore the sector so they can better exploit its resources and further establish the new Second Duchy.</t>

	  <t id="321">The existence of this sector was thought to be little more than a legend. That was until a lone Boron pilot, crazed with fear and exhaustion, was picked up in the nearby sector, Menelaus' Paradise. He died shortly after rescue while babbling desperately about an eternal cosmic horror buried deep within the skin of a "dark planet". Because of this the Argon would send numerous spy probes to investigate yet no discovery was ever made public.\n\nFollowing Realignment, Matrix #596 is a part of what the Alliance refers to as a "Xenon supercluster", an area of the Networked dominated by the intensely strong signals emanating from within and the seemingly frenzied Xenon to protect it. Of much concern however, is that the once alien-like world has evolved into a writhing sea of flames and molten rock on a scale which even surpassed the worlds ravaged by the Xenon superweapon.</t>
	  <t id="330">{20005,3037}(Perdition's End)</t>
	  <t id="331">Perdition's flames brought fear to the hearts of both Argon and Paranid, with fury and rage from both sides having fed the firestorm that burned through this sector. \n\nPerdition's end may soon be near, but the fires of conquest still burn brightly.</t>

	  <t id="350">{20005,7043}(Titania)</t>
	  <t id="351">Situated in close proximity to Uranus's largest moon, Titania, this sector was the primary base for the AGI Task Force prior to their merger into the wider Terran Protectorate. Now operating under the banner of the Intervention Corps, Titania has once again been built to deal with every operation or contingency which the Corps may have to commit to as part of their operational scope. \n\nDespite the organization's new name, Titania retains many of the old ATF landmark stations like the Military Flight School and the Central Intelligence Service which acts as an isolated branch of the Terran Secret Service despite the restructuring that was demanded after the Torus Aeternal was destroyed. \n\nDue Titania's close proximity to the Neptune gate it is believed that much of the protection and security of Outer Sol is organized here and following the recent rumors of Yaki involvement with the Pioneers, many have openly advocated for the return of ATF proper.</t>
	  <t id="360">{20005,3020}(Xaar's Belt)</t>
	  <t id="361">Following the reconnection of both Clarity's End and Perdition's End, Godrealm of the Paranid sent scouts to delve deeper into the new unknown and found this previously unidentified sector, believing it to be a sign from the holy three-dimensionality and immediately dispatched ships to establish three sets of superhighways.</t>
	  <t id="370">{20005,3020} {20402,1}(Xaar's Belt I)</t>
	  <t id="371">Situated between the planet's two moons, Xaar's Belt I is rich in methane and acts as the anchor in the superhighway connections as the scouts identified the, at the time, inactive gate which now connects to the Xenon infested Matrix #596.</t>
	  <t id="380">{20005,3020} {20402,2}(Xaar's Belt II)</t>
	  <t id="381">The sector's asteroid belt is the result of the second moon's slow decay caused by the planet's gravity pulling it down, which ultimately will result in the moon's impact on the planet's surface and the certain destruction of any potential planetary colony.</t>
	  <t id="390">{20005,3020} {20402,3}(Xaar's Belt III)</t>
	  <t id="391">When the Paranid scouts first entered the system via the Clarity's End gate they were met with the brilliance of the local sun's blue corona and began surveying the first moon while venturing deeper into the system, probing for any other potential gates before they made unexpected contact with another team of Paranid scouts who arrived via the Perdition's End gate.</t>
	  <t id="400">Thuruk's Legacy</t>
	  <t id="401">A newly discovered sector claimed by Patriarch Than of the Strong Arms Corporation, this sector was named in veneration of the great Patriarch Thuruk. The planet, Thu-Ingtar was colonized by both Families Than and Thi in recognition of their joint leadership of "The Warlords' Domain" and to ease the economic strain of Patriarch's Keep.\n\nDuring the Shutdown this sector was one of the two which were colonized by the Strong Arms Corporation and is directly connected to the "Enduring Shores" Boron sectors. \n\nThuruk's Legacy now stands as the crossroads against the Atreus Corporation and is host to numerous skirmishes during the long isolation. Originally, the over zealous Patriarch Than conducted an invasion of Queen's Retribution when orbital assets were being evacuated and while the assault succeeded in ravaging the remaining Boron military, it was equally destructive on the Split, leading to neither side having the advantage over the other.</t>
	  <t id="410">{20005,5044}(Family Than)</t>
	  <t id="411">Prior to the Shutdown, Patriarch Than was simply the director of the Strong Arms corporation, but following this he seized power in the now completely cutoff Split sectors which now included this previously unknown sector before Family Thi had even scouted it. \n\nWhile all real power was still centered within Thyn's Excavation via the Strong Arms Corporation, Patriarch Than was eager to further validate his new title and laid claim to the entire system. However, following reconnection to the Network and under the threats of Patriarch Zyarth, both Patriarchs Than and Thi fell in line and, officially, are subservient to Patriarch Zyarth. In reality the Strong Arms Corporation still has complete authority within the "Warlord's Dominion" and makes no illusions otherwise.</t>
	  <t id="420">{20005,5044} {20402,1}(Family Than I)</t>
	  <t id="421">The capital of Family Than and political seat of their power within the "Warlords' Dominion", this sector is arguably the second most important Split sector because of the crucial ore mined from the asteroid belt. \n\nOnce reconnected to the Gate Network, Patriarch Zyarth demanded Family Than yield to his authority or risk the same fate as the formally Free Families. While officially subservient, Patriarch Than is still the director of the Strong Arms Corporation and has refused to degrade his status.</t>
	  <t id="430">{20005,5044} {20402,2}(Family Than II)</t>
	  <t id="431">Pushed further out from the planet's orbit, Family Than II is the location of a previously inactive gate which has only very recently reconnected to the wider Network via what remains of Thyn's Abyss. \n\nA major source of ore for the Split within the "Warlords' Dominion", this system is very busy with industrial ships traversing acrossing the sector to keep the ever demanding Strong Arms war machine running.</t>
	  <t id="440">{20005,5005}(Thyn's Abyss)</t>
	  <t id="441">This deep space system was about as close as the Split got to a civilian operation and once produced food and other organic products while mines on the asteroids spread across the system. Due to the lack of any real military presence the sector was quickly overwhelmed by Xenon forces before they withdrew back to Matrix #472D just before the Great Shutdown.</t>
	  <t id="450">{20005,5034}(Thyn's Excavation)</t>
	  <t id="451">The location of the Strong Arms Headquarters, Thyn's Excavation provided funds and resources for the ongoing conflict in the local area against not just the nearby Boron but across the entire old Network and continues to be very well guarded by the aptly named corporation. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown, Strong Arms took complete control of the local Split sectors in what became known as the "Warlords' Dominion" ruled by the self appointed Patriarch Than, the director of the Strong Arms Corporation.</t>
	  <t id="460">{20005,9008}(Blue Horizon)</t>
	  <t id="461">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector was officially designated "Distant Clouds" and was the location of a disappointing mineral survey conducted by the Boron Royal Research Institute. Despite the poor results efforts continued to probe the sector for anything of value as it was reconnected to the "Enduring Shores" of the Atreus Corporation who deployed their only Superhighway following a review of the previous survey and the discovery that the results were intentionally fabricated for unknown purposes and obscured the fact that the sector was extremely mineral rich. \n\nHome to most of what was the "Enduring Shores" mining operations, Blue Horizon is as critical as ever against the local Split and Xenon threat.</t>
	  <t id="470">{20005,9008} {20402,1}(Blue Horizon I)</t>
	  <t id="471">Settled as a result of the Atreus Corporation's construction of the Superhighway, Blue Horizon I is abundant in both methane and silicon, further proof that the Boron Royal Research Institute's mineral survey was a complete lie. \n\nSituated further into the Blue Horizon sector, it is less guarded than its companion and is directly connected to Queen's Harbour. However following the recent reconnection to the Network and the previously inactive gate to Great Trench now online and showing concerning signs of Xenon, the Atreus Corporation has begun to divert newly supplied Queendom military assets to better protect this vital system.</t>	  
	  <t id="480">{20005,9008} {20402,4}(Blue Horizon IV)</t>
	  <t id="481">The original core of the sector, Blue Horizon IV is where the erroneous survey was conducted which stated that the sector was devoid of mineral value despite the presence of a significant asteroid field. \n\nAs such, Blue Horizon I is a vital source of ore for the Atreus Corporation's operation in the "Enduring Shores" and is generally well guarded against any potential Split incursion from the "Warlord's Dominion".</t>	  
	  <t id="490">{20005,2007}(Great Trench)</t>
	  <t id="491">This Boron mining colony was once a busy hub of both industry and as a refit and supply center for Boron ships working in the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids made the Boron who lived here harder and more cynical than those in the home systems, \n\nOnce isolated, the colony very quickly fell apart as they were unable to produce their own food and quickly burned through any stockpiles they had gathered.</t>
	  <t id="500">{20005,2017}(Queen's Harbour)</t>
	  <t id="501">Once specialising in food and power storage technology, Queen's Harbour is the location of the original Atreus Headquarters that was lost when the Gates began to shut down. While the remnants of the corporation reestablished themselves in Ocean of Fantasy before collapsing under the stewardship of the Provinces Adrift, Atreus proper became the driving force in the "Enduring Shores" of Queen's Harbour, Queen's Retribution, Rolk's Legacy, and the formally colonized Blue Horizon. \n\nNow that connection has been reestablished these sectors immediately rejoined the Queendom but are still formally run by the Atreus Corporation due to the vast distance between them and Kingdom's End.</t>
	  <t id="510">{20005,2018}(Queen's Retribution)</t>
	  <t id="511">Formally a Boron core sector specialising in technological and military output, Queen's Retribution was established to strike out against a growing conflict with the Split. During the Great Shutdown the new Boron colonies were completely disconnected from the wider network and instead were locked into a bitter conflict with the equally trapped "Warlords' Dominion" Split. \n\nWhile originally the home of the local Boron Shipyard, Queen's Retribution found itself now on the frontline in the local conflict. As such, all vital infrastructure was moved to the more secure Queen's Harbour and brought completely under the control of the Atreus Corporation.</t>

	  <t id="521">Once a Split mining outpost, one day a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by the Argon security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a radioactive hell and access to the system was restricted. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon superweapon was to blame. \n\nPrior to the Shutdown pilots who passed through this system once reported a large ship but those reports ceased and if the ship existed, its presence and location was never known and the Xenon presence in the system has only further increased following The Collapse.</t>

	  <t id="591">Once deep in unclaimed space, Bala Gi's Joy is home to a cratered moon, used as a scrapyard for the wreckage of the many ship disabled and then stripped by the pirates of the past following ambushing and attacking traveling ships. These same pirates were then trapped following the Shutdown and forced to survive on what little was left in the system following the years of stealing everything of value from the corpses of the dead. \n\nThey did not survive long.</t>

"Teladi Blues" is still appreciated by many sentient species post-Shutdown. \n\nWhile the system has definitely seen better days, it did survive being isolated and alone. Strict austerity measures were put in place and the orbital nostrop oil stations were dismantled and brought to the planet where the local Teladi were already establishing fields of sunrise flowers.</t>

Every aspect of the environment appears to have been meticulously controlled, its clinical perfection masks a cold and unfeeling order.

The Vault was a system hard to reach by normal means and contained nothing but high tech stations. Home to the Teladi Company's main research facility, it always tried to improve upon existing technology.\n\nWhile expected to expand and greatly improve the Company's assets, The Vault was lost to the Shutdown and all hopes and aspirations were lost with it when the colonists were unable to sustain their own survival. Since the sector's reconnection the Teladi Company have attempted to reestablish themselves but so far have had limited success.</t>

	  <t id="631">This sector is home to the lesser Split family, Family Lomm. Native to the Wretched Skies sector, Family Lomm has recently come into skirmishes with the new arrival of the previously nomadic pirates of Family Valka as they began to aggressively police and harass ships traveling the route into the rest of Split space. While they hold little of value, Family Lomm's standing within the Split Patriarchy has seen a noticeable rise due to their evolving trade relationship with the neighboring Paranid, unlike Family Phi who have taken a more aggressive approach against them. Not many know of Family Lomm and it is unlikely many more ever will, but this level of anonymity has help elevate many once great families to the heights of their power.</t>

	  <t id="651">Claimed shortly after the Paranid established themselves in the system, this sector acts as a midway between the access points of both the local Split families and is a vital source of methane for the growing Xaarist Empire. The military presence in this space is relatively sparse at times as it is seen as somewhat safe in comparison to the rest of the space claimed by the Paranid.</t>
	  <t id="660">{20005,9002} {20402,15}(Wretched Skies XV)</t>
	  <t id="661">The furthest out sector within the Wretched Skies system, this cold region of space is the final leg on the tour of the solar system and home to a previously unknown gate which was only discovered by scouts from Duke's Vision. This immense stroke of luck was taken as an act of divination and the approval of Xaar as it created a full loop for the new Empire, allowing non combative ships to travel a route not in immediate danger of the Xenon.</t>
	  <t id="670">{20005,3027}(Duke's Vision)</t>
	  <t id="671">Long ago this sector was visited by the last great Duke of the old Empire and after a few short hours he collapsed and fell unconscious. When he awoke he claimed to have had visions of a great battle between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known as the Kha'ak. The great Duke decided to consult the monks of the Great Monastery on Paranid Prime, in the valley of the setting star. While his visions did not occur again, he was granted permission to build a new temple in the sector where he saw the great battle. He died without ever knowing the true nature of what he saw, or the horror that would follow.\n\nFollowing the Shutdown the Xaarist faith subsumed Duke's Vision into their growing influence, convincing the population that the prophecy of the great battle had yet to occur and that the great Emperor was testing his people so that the most faithful would become his warriors in a war to forever purge the existence of the Kha'ak.</t>
	  <t id="680">{20005,3031}(Emperor's Wisdom)</t>
	  <t id="681">This sector is considered to be one of the highest importance. When the Xenon nearly destroyed Paranid Prime's atmosphere, the equatorial region home to his palace was all but lost. In order to keep the ancient tradition a new winter palace was established in Emperor's Wisdom, overlooking a great lake at the foot of the Kar Miat Mountains. During the winter of Paranid Prime the Emperor would then usually occupy this sector along with his advisory Dukes.\n\nDuring the Shutdown the Emperor was not in his palace and instead was hosting two prominent members of the Xaarist faith and one of his Dukes. These three would quickly take the titles of "Deacon" and become the dominant leaders of this new Paranid Empire.</t>
	  <t id="690">{20005,3024}(Consecrated Fire)</t>
	  <t id="691">The fire pits of the planet of XaarXen were deemed to be holy by the priests of the Paranid Xaarist religion, after the original expedition vessel was consumed by a firestorm that formed from one of these pits.\n\nWhile disconnected from the wider network during the Great Shutdown, Consecrated Fires stayed connected to both Emperor's Wisdom and Duke's Vision and these three sectors would become the backbone of the new empire of Xaar's Faithful. Initially the Xaarist's seat of power was on the planet XaarXen before being consumed by holy fire. Despite being seen as a holy act from Emperor Xaar himself, it was accepted that having a functional government ruled from such a volatile planet may not be the best course of action.</t>
	  <t id="700">{20005,9022}(Danna's Chance)</t>
	  <t id="701">This lawless system was the hub of the black market in both food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants had made a fortune trading the illicit goods while many more were not so fortunate and lost not only their wealth but for many, their lives.\n\nDuring the Shutdown these local pirates banded together and became quite a formidable organization which could even rival those in Gunne's Crusade once they came into contact with each other. Ultimately these various factions would coalesce into a single ruthless and cutthroat criminal syndicate which maintained a firm grip on the resources available across the sectors.\n\nFollowing the reactivation of the Gates the Scale Plate Pact managed to convince the pirates to join their organization in return for a significant investment and economic boost to their operations in the area.</t>
	  <t id="710">{20005,1034}(Legend's Home)</t>
	  <t id="711">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector simply did not exist on navigation systems with any rumors ruthlessly squashed until OTAS was ready for the sector to be made public. A center for high tech research and development, Legend's Home is the beating heart of OTAS's power. \n\nAs the gates began to flicker, OTAS launched an invasion into the neighbouring sector of Akeela's Beacon after a dispute over financial bureaucracy would see the government's support of OTAS dwindle substantially. However, once the Great Shutdown began and OTAS was thrown into the dark they returned to their roots, albeit with significantly reduced wages, and are now even more technologically advanced than they have ever been.</t>
	  <t id="720">{20005,6043}(Ministry of Finance)</t>
	  <t id="721">Once a sector of pride for local Teladi, the high tower of the Ministry of Finance stands tall on the planet's surface. The Ministry was established to oversee the Company's finances when establishing new sectors, although this wing of the Teladi Company wasn't entirely successful. When the then neighbouring system of Bad Debt first opened to the public and ran into trouble the Ministry was held responsible.\n\nFollowing this, the Ministry was reorganized into the military it is known as today and then the sector was rediscovered they immediately seized control and moved all of their stationary orbital assets, firmly establishing it once again as the heart of their organization and its goals.</t>
	  <t id="730">{20005,1024}(Akeela's Beacon)</t>
	  <t id="731">The four great stars which grace this sector were created following the tragic but noble sacrifice of Akeela Hartnell. Her last will was for the Argon Federation to govern the new system and make it a safe haven for all traders. \n\nHowever, this dream was crushed shortly before the Great Shutdown when the OTAS corporation invaded and occupied the system to deprive the remaining Argon colonies of vital sources of energy. Initially this occupation was justified as a necessary step towards securing the well-being of the system's population but post-Shutdown OTAS reinforced their presence in the sector, developing it into a proper first line of defence should anyone, or anything, attempt to attack Legend's Home.</t>
	  <t id="740">{20005,1025}(Aladna Hill)</t>
	  <t id="741">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war, Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. Following the OTAS invasion of Akeela's Beacon the Argon Federation began to amass military assets with the goal of reclaiming the system and to bring the corporation to justice. \n\nPost-Shutdown these military assets were used to keep law and order both in Aladna Hill and Light of Heart as an uneasy trade agreement was struck between the remnants of the Argon Navy and OTAS. Neither side had the resources alone to survive but if they cooperated they both could survive. Because of this agreement neither side would be able to recover their pre-war strength as each silently agreed to heavily restrict the flow of certain wares.\n\nNow that Aladna Hill has rejoined the Federation there is talk about finally putting an end to the OTAS corporation, but surprisingly the local Argon argue that without their aid and cooperation, everyone would be dead.</t>
	  <t id="750">{20005,1035}(Light of Heart)</t>
	  <t id="751">The source of ships and equipment for the Argon settlements claimed following the conclusion of the last Xenon war, Light of Heart was the epicenter of the Argon military's efforts to reclaimed Akeela's Beacon following the surprise invasion from OTAS. Unfortunately,  the Great Shutdown began before this counterattack was fully planned and instead was initiated with a much smaller force as a significant portion of the Argon Navy had not arrived yet. While the attack was not successful in liberating Akeela's Beacon, it did ravage both the existing Argon Navy and OTAS fleets and forced them into an armistice, both sides knowing that a prolonged conflict would doom both their populations.\n\nDuring the isolation, Light of Heart functioned as the de facto capital of the Argon enclave and when the Gates did finally start to flicker on it was swiftly reintegrated into the Federation who invested heavily in modernizing the local shipyard and equipment dock.</t>
	  <t id="760">{20005,1037}(Montalaar)</t>
	  <t id="761">An old mining outpost founded in near orbit of the arid world "Hitt's Eye", Montalaar had been an Argon settlement in the areas of space claimed following the Xenon conflict. \n\nTrading, food, and materials installations had been constructed in service to the private mining outfits looking to exploit new minerals but following the Shutdown these facilities were slowly decommissioned to keep the orbital station host to a small colony from falling apart. Now that the sector is reconnected, survivors have begun to be relocated across the Federation and the reintegration of the sector has begun.</t>
	  <t id="770">{20005,6042}(Mines of Fortune)</t>
	  <t id="771">Once the largest Teladi mining operation in history following the Teladi discovering and retrofitting abandoned space stations set into mineral-rich asteroids. The vast richness of the sector would be of no consolation to those left behind following its complete isolation as there was no infrastructure in place to refine the raw ore and silicon into usable products. It appears that the entire sector collapsed, unable to provide power and food to the doomed residents. \n\nCuriously the previously retrofitted mining stations are absent from the sector, their fates unknown.</t>
	  <t id="780">{20005,5037}(Zyarth's Stand)</t>
	  <t id="781">Originally little more than a desolate fallback for Family Zyarth once they had been cut off and trapped behind the Xenon, Zyarth's Stand became home to a Split Equipment Dock and the remaining Zyarth forces prior to the Great Shutdown yet even these gates immediately began to flickering following Family Zyarth's total assault against the Xenon. Now reconnected to Zyarth's Dominion, Patriarch Zyarth is eager to reclaim the system and fully integrate it into his new empire.</t>
	  <t id="790">{20005,5039}(Patriarch's Conclusion)</t>
	  <t id="791">Once one of the Split's most remote core sectors with a moderate output of agricultural products. Military operations here served as the base for the building conflict in nearby sectors due to the ever increasing tensions with the Boron which finally escalated to outright war following the Great Shutdown.\n\nFollowing its reconnection, Zyarth scouts discovered that all orbital assets had been destroyed as the result of some undocumented war. Worse yet there was no evidence of any Boron wreckage or losses in the conflict which was either the result of sheer overwhelming numbers or the failings of these clearly disgraceful Split.\n\nRecently the sector has seen new life, with an organization of Split called "Thuruk's Remembrance" recovering the wreckage and refurbishing what they can, believing that modern Split designs have deviated too far from being "truly Split".</t>
	  <t id="800">Argon Sector M148</t>
	  <t id="801">Fully militarized and with all traffic under intense scrutiny, this sector was host to the combined military might of Operation Final Fury. Completed shortly before the Great Shutdown, Final Fury was the Commonwealth's answer to Kha'ak aggression. What was believed to be the source or homeworld of the Kha'ak was found and an immense military force destroyed everything they could. Following the successful completion of the operation, the sector quickly shifted to operations against the Terrans when war broke out due to the fully operational ship production capabilities.\n\nAs the gates began to shut down, forces within the sector were cut off from the rest of the Federation for several years before ultimately connecting to the Argon colonies besieged by Split aggression. The military then moved quickly to annex both Eleventh Hour and Guiding Star and established The Enclave to stand against the Zyarth Patriarchy.</t>
	  <t id="810">{20005,1039}(Nyana's Hideout)</t>
	  <t id="811">Named after the Argon heroine and Goner priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. Prior to the Great Shutdown the sector had fallen on hard times, hardening the people which served them well in the isolation. Following the Gates' reactivation, Nyana's Hideout connected to the still isolated Argon sectors near the newly formed empire of Patriarch Zyarth and became a shelter for refugees fleeing the frequent slave raids.</t>
	  <t id="820">{20005,1033}(Interworlds)</t>
	  <t id="821">Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food to the rest of the Argon Federation, Interworlds expanded to include more high-tech stations and products. Once home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, they were not present in the system during the Great Shutdown. What remained was unable to maintain the stations and slowly they were decommissioned to maintain the supply of food.</t>
	  <t id="830">{20005,1048}(Wastelands)</t>
	  <t id="831">Once named Light of Hope until the Xenon attacked many years ago and it was clear that the patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using whatever transport ships were available. A large force of four Titan class Destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with full fighter wings were dispatched to escort the fleeing transports but were overwhelmed by a Xenon fleet with only the civilian ships and a lone destroyer, the Challenger, escaping.\n\nThree years later a joint Argon-Boron force reclaimed the sector and recolonization began. Unfortunately the Great Shutdown once again thwarted this sector's progress and what had been established has fallen into complete disrepair and the surviving colonists eking out a meager existence.</t>
	  <t id="840">{20005,5021}(Ghinn's Escape)</t>
	  <t id="841">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further into the area it once connected to, this Split colony was once heavily guarded and a large manufacturer of surveillance equipment and defensive weapons allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. Members of both Families Tkr and Njy were often found in this sector given its close proximity to their space and even saw some skirmishes between them following Family Njy's invasion and occupation of Family Tkr's territory as a result of the Dragon Incident. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown this colony completely collapsed and was entirely isolated for decades. The surviving Split families are only just now learning of Patriarch Zyarth's aggression while the sector itself has become a hub for the Fallen Families as they have bolstered their ranks with the inhabitants of Ghinn's Escape.</t>

Now that the gates have reactivated Teladi scouts have so far only found the debris of both Teladi and pirate forces along with the shattered remains of old stations with unconfirmed reports that the other gate is also active.</t>

	  <t id="921">A previously hidden sector locked behind the OTAS Headquarters of Legend's Home. Despite the close proximity and abundance of mineral resources, this sector has not been incorporated into the OTAS Corporation's holdings as it was not a threat to their security and no local facilities were required.\n\nDuring the Great Shutdown, OTAS would make an uneasy truce with the local Argon Navy, exchanging locally mined silicon for ore mined in Argon controlled Aladna Hill. It was because of this increased activity that OTAS became aware of an inactive gate located on the very fringes of the system which they then towed closer so they could better monitor it in the future. Eventually this gate would activate and provide another means of access to and from OTAS controlled space.</t>
	  <t id="930">{20005,3014}(Tebathimanckatt's Legacy)</t>
	  <t id="931">A dim, unpopulated sector along the Paranid border region, Tebathimanckatt's Legacy saw only cursory resource surveys when its jumpgate connection opened from Pious Mists IV, with the Godrealm being preoccupied with reconsolidating its holdings as the gate system began to awaken. This attitude changed following the discovery of the breakaway Holy Order and their heretic Pontifex, which coincided with a flurry of rumors that the sector's name was more than symbolic and that hidden somewhere within were artifacts of great power once held by Admiral Tebathimanckatt himself. \n\nThough these artifacts never materialized despite an intense search by private citizens and Godrealm-affiliated forces alike, the discovery of the jumpgate connecting to Perpetual Sin III saw the system's status skyrocket from quiet Godrealm backwater to a critical strategic avenue and second war front. Forming a potential path to strike at their enemy's interior regions, achieving military control over the sector became a high priority for both factions.</t>
	  <t id="940">{20005,3046}(Untainted Eternity)</t>
	  <t id="941">Situated above the accretion disc of a black hole - this sector is completely unknown and new to the Gate Network, unspoiled by centuries of conflict. \n\nCuriously, and troubling to many, the time dilation expected from such close proximity to a black hole is not observed here and even more concerning signals are somehow being emitted from within the black hole, which should be impossible.</t>
	  <t id="950">{20005,1011}(Belt of Aguilar)</t>
	  <t id="951">Founded shortly after the first Kha'ak invasions, as a support outpost for the nearby colonies, Belt of Aguilar has had a short but turbulent history. With the rise of the newly relocated Jonferco, this sector initially enjoyed good prospects as it housed the only gate to the newly discovered Albion system; which was a playground for corporations to test new technologies and extract the vast mineral riches. \n\nHowever, following the destruction of the original Jonferco Headquarters and the shutdown of the Albion gate, the sector's future became uncertain. During the Great Shutdown what was left of the Jonferco corporation began to rebuild and return to their roots while efforts were made in attempting to reactivate the Albion gate.</t>

Even before the Great Shutdown the sector had been run into disrepair with even new stations being poorly maintained, pirate activity had increased, and remains of a minefield played by the T'kr were scattered about. \n\nNow reconnected, Family Tkr attempted to reclaim and rebuild the sector before the disastrous loss in Fires of Defeat. To make a bad situation even worse it's been confirmed that the Northern gate is connected to a dangerous Xenon Matrix.</t>

What little was known showed that Matrix #695 was surprisingly sparse with most assets presumably moved to higher priority Xenon-controlled sectors. However, it is clear that either prior to the Shutdown or during it, Matrix #695 has evolved into a major threat to the wider Network now with full ship production capabilities.</t>

While the exact reason for this is still unknown, it is highly speculated that the Xenon were responsible in a bid to destroy Aldrin.\n\nThankfully for the residents of the Lost Colony the Xenon failed and now The Bastion has become a battleground between these bitter adversaries. However, following both Aldrin's connection to Megnir and then Matrix #48's connection to Althes, this sector's hostility has dramatically lowered as both sides are diverting efforts and resources elsewhere.</t>
	  <t id="1040">{20005,1029}(Cloudbase South West)</t>
	  <t id="1041">A crowded system which produced high quality wares for the Argon Federation, Cloudbase South West was used by the Goner as a base in their search for the origins of sentient life throughout the known universe. Many had spent their lives in study of ancient legends and engaged in deep historical analysis that eventually lead to the existence of Earth being proven to be more than just a myth. \n\nWhen the Goner left the system began a slow decline as relations with the neighboring Paranid Empire remained heated with skirmishes flaring up from time to time.

In the years since the Shutdown all orbital assets have completely fallen apart and the solar output plummeted to nearly zero, with all inhabitants driven to the planet's surface.</t>

	  <t id="1061">This bleak region was once home to the Yaki pirate faction. While dozens of rumours swirled regarding the sector prior to The Shutdown, little else was ever confirmed and only speculations were left.</t>
	  <t id="1070">{20005,5012}(Patriarch's Seat)</t>
	  <t id="1071">Once known as Menelaus' Paradise, this sector was brutally conquered by the Patriarch Rhonkar during the Shutdown once it became isolated and dangerously connected to Family Pride. While the invasion was swift and absolute, the Split victory was short lived as the sector's gates once again went dark for several years until it reconnected to a newly emerging and dominant Family Zyarth. Recognized as a powerful symbol of Split domination and a convenient way to further erode the prestige of Patriarch Rhonkar, Patriarch Zyarth seized the sector for himself and ordered the construction of the great War Forge. Naming it as the new seat of power for the Split, one to surpass even the greatness of Family Pride.</t>
	  <t id="1080">{20005,9023}(Desecrated Skies)</t>
	  <t id="1081">Savaged by conflict, greed, brief isolation, and finally a civil war, Desecrated Skies had forever been embroiled in turmoil. Internal power-struggles between various different pirate factions left any entry to the sector one of immense risk. The Paranid had made frequent, forceful, attempts to cleanse the sector but never succeeded.\n\nIn a stroke of both good and bad luck, Desecrated Skies did not stay completely isolated for very long, having very quickly connected to another pirate haven, Gunne's Crusade. The unfortunate effect of this, however, was that the minor pirates were quickly and brutally destroyed or subsumed into the greater clans they now shared space with.</t>
	  <t id="1090">{20005,9025}(Gunne's Crusade)</t>
	  <t id="1091">A known haven for pirate forces, the sector was discovered after an attack in Montalaar led the Argon security forces through Rolk's Legacy and right to the distant gate. Since then the Argon had continued to deploy forces in an effort to take control of the sector once and for all. However, this effort became a long and protracted affair with the Argon Federation sinking, what many believed, an unreasonable amount of credits into the endeavor.\n\nBefore the Gates began to deactivate, the Argon had begun to deploy 2 Superhighways in an attempt to expand and solidify their control of the sector, but these plans were ruined when the Gate suddenly shutdown, leaving only the builders with the gates and a meager amount of the Argon Navy for protection.</t>
	  <t id="1100">{20005,9025} {20402,1}(Gunne's Crusade I)</t>
	  <t id="1101">After the Gates shutdown local pirates quickly overwhelmed the Argon forces protecting the transports carrying new Superhighways. While these were initially held by rival organizations, increasingly dwindling resources would cause a large mutiny in both simultaneously and see them both deployed in an effort to expand and search for any chance of salvation.\n\nAs luck would have it the pirates would discover a previously unknown planet in the distant edges of the system that, while not entirely hospitable, was habitable. Since then the pirates have made the planet, The Forge, into both their bastion and stronghold, having quickly dominated the other pirate clans in both Desecrated Skies and Danna's Chance. Following the Realignment an agreement was made with the Scale Plate Pact to operate under the same banner in exchange for a significant investment into the region's infrastructure.</t>
	  <t id="1110">{20005,9025} {20402,2}(Gunne's Crusade II)</t>
	  <t id="1111">A buffer between the pirates of Gunne's Crusade and those found within Danna’s Chance, this region of the system is now the home of the sector’s second gate following the extreme effort to tow it. While the pirates of Danna's Chance were more numerous they were still far too fractured to put up a cohesive defence and were quickly subjugated, just as those in Desecrated Skies.\n\nOnce both sectors were brought under control every effort was made to properly distribute resources across the small hermit kingdom and a significant effort was put into constructing a rudimentary shipyard. However, following the agreement with the Scale Plate Pact and the influx of resources, this crude construct was dismantled and replaced with a proper, modern, wharf while the true shipyard would be constructed in Gunne's Crusade I.</t>
	  <t id="1120">{20005,9025} {20402,3}(Gunne's Crusade III)</t>
	  <t id="1121">The original region of space prior to the deploying of the Superhighways, Gunne's Crusade III is the primary source of both ore and silicon within this small pirate hermit kingdom. Following the reconnection to Desecrated Skies and the near immediate skirmishes as a result, the "Gunne Pirates" quickly established several defence stations before ultimately making their push and subjugating their erstwhile rivals. Not long after this the other gate reactivated and now connected to Danna's Chance and the decision was made to tow the gate a significant distance after the successful deployment of the Superhighway into Gunne's Crusade II.</t>

	  <t id="1131">Although many ships had been sent to survey the sector, few had ever returned resulting in it being shunned by all factions within the Old Network. The last surveillance records show that the system was once home to a pirate base having been set up to search for valuable salvage and easy money following a Xenon fleet jumping to a nearby sector, only for them to return in vast numbers. The Xenon then laid a near constant siege on the base, established complete dominion over the sector, and blocked any means of escape. Knowing that evacuations would be futile, and with no other options, the pirates attempted to hold their position but ultimately were completely eradicated.\n\nNow that the Gates have reactivated, Matrix #597 is a part of a "Xenon supercluster" and while it appears to not be a vital sector it is still tactically important.</t>
	  <t id="1140">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,5}{20404,3}{20404,4}(Matrix #534)</t>
	  <t id="1141">Discovered while scouts were exploring Getsu Fune, Matrix #534 was initially cleared by a very small force of ships. However, soon after this mission was completed the Argon destroyer was ambushed, presumed destroyed, and never heard from again. The captain's last report stated that an enormous force of Xenon entered the sector from an unexplored gate, the position of which was not recorded. Since then the sector had rarely been entered and it was considered by the Argon to be somewhat cursed by nature.\n\nUnfortunately, if the Argon had properly monitored the sector they would have seen that the Xenon were amassing and building up the sector into a proper stronghold, seemingly aware of the impending Shutdown and eventual reconnection elsewhere.</t>
	  <t id="1150">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,5}{20404,3}{20404,4}{20403,2}(Matrix #534B)</t>
	  <t id="1151">Matrix #534B is the original entry point which was once connected to Getsu Fune and it is here that the Argon forces were ambushed and destroyed. Since then the Xenon have entrenched themselves entirely into the system and appear to have established this space as a buffer zone between potential outside threats and the source of their presence in the area.\n\nCuriously, there is a fully operational Superhighway which has no known point of origin. While clearly constructed prior to the Shutdown, there was never any record of a Superhighway project in this part of the old Network beyond the now conquered Menelaus' Paradise.</t>
	  <t id="1160">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,5}{20404,3}{20404,4}{20403,1}(Matrix #534A)</t>
	  <t id="1161">The heart of the swarm, Matrix #534A lies deep in the sector past a Superhighway of unknown origin. From here the Xenon machines are forged and sent out into the wider Network. While very little is known about this dangerous area of space, what is known is that an unidentified structure is emanating intensely strong signals which have been detected far across the Network. The purpose of these signals are unknown but the Alliance of the Word believes they have detected similar signals originating from Matrix #23.</t>	  
	  <t id="1170">{20005,1030}(Elena's Fortune)</t>
	  <t id="1171">After the Kha'ak attack on President's End, a decision was made to improve the security of the Argon Home systems, resulting in a taskforce being assembled in The Wall and sent to secure Elena's Fortune. Orders given were to capture and retake the sector following the Kha'ak decimating the pirate forces who had held control for so long. Argon surveillance expeditions later discovered that the Kha'ak attack destroyed the gate leading to, what was at the time, the neighbouring system of Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
	  <t id="1180">{20005,1030} {20402,1}(Elena's Fortune I)</t>
	  <t id="1181">Elena's Fortune I is the original core of the once undivided sector. Prior to the total Shutdown the Argon Federation deployed some of their first prototype Trans-Orbital Accelerators in an attempt to further expand their economy and relative safe space. In the years since these initial Accelerators have since been decommissioned, both because of their unreliability and the development of superior Superhighway technology.</t>
	  <t id="1190">{20005,1030} {20402,2}(Elena's Fortune II)</t>
	  <t id="1191">Previously designated as the "beta" companion, Elena's Fortune II is home to the sector's rich asteroids in addition to the now inactive Gate that once connected to President's End. Perhaps due to this connection being severed and the system’s relative safety within the new structure of the Argon Federation, security forces are generally very light.</t>
	  <t id="1200">{20005,1044}(Ringo Moon)</t>
	  <t id="1201">The spiritual home of the popular Argon sport known as "Hardball", Ringo Moon was once designated as little more than an outpost of basic installations and acted as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area and produced only the basic products more required by small ships and installations. This designation changed during the Terran Conflict as the Federation began to ramp up production of military equipment in the Home Systems to better support the war effort in Omicron Lyrae. As a result there was not only a significant boost in population, but also the infrastructure necessary to support such a burgeoning demand.\n\Though one of the first sectors to have been lost to the Shutdown along with neighboring Red Light, the residents of the sector continued to flourish, even developing new and innovative rules for "Hardball".</t>
	  <t id="1210">{20005,1043}(Red Light)</t>
	  <t id="1211">Red Light had always been a place of fierce competition, both in finance and military. Once scouted, the Argon military took full advantage of what was, at the time, the rich resources in the area which created a thriving market for the exportation of minerals. Unfortunately, this would result in these resources being depleted shortly before the conclusion of the Terran Conflict. Despite this, the system was still valuable, having developed a good selection of surplus weapon systems and aiding in the resupply of local Argon fighters.\n\nLost in the Shutdown along with Ringo Moon, this sector fared less favorably than its companion. Already supporting a significantly lower population and painfully short on amenities beyond basic needs, Red Light became little more than a backwater. This term would come to have a double meaning, however, as it is also home to the last remnants of its rich past - ice.</t>

	  <t id="1230">{20005,5003}(Patriarch's Keep)</t>
	  <t id="1231">Situated in a heavy asteroid belt, this forbidding Split mining colony had grown into the second capital system of Split space. It was a successful trading location due to the previous connection to Teladi space and provided much needed support for local Split military ships. The sector is still run by the relatively liberal Family Thi who do not use forced labour in their factories and have aligned with the much more militarily powerful Family Than of the Strong Arms Corporation.\n\nThis alliance has expanded throughout the entire "Warlord's Domain" as it is Family Thi who control all civilian and infrastructure while Family Than, via the Strong Arms Corporation, are the active military. Both because of their isolation and due to Family Thi's influence, the entire "Warlord's Domain" does not use forced labour or slavery of any kind.</t>
	  <t id="1240">{20005,2024}(Rolk's Legacy)</t>
	  <t id="1241">Developed with the aid of the Argon, this sector was one of the new Boron colonies founded after the end of the last Xenon war. Having suffering heavy losses to both the Split and Xenon, the Boron were eager not to confine themselves to a small cluster of systems as they had done for so long. Prior to the Shutdown the foundations of a thriving mining colony were already completed and the next stage of growth was already well underway.\n\nThankfully, when the West Gate lost its connection to Lucky Planets it was immediately reconnected to the already very well established Queen's Harbour, sparing it the fate of Great Trench. Now the planet is home to the second largest population within the "Enduring Shores" as a result of the massive population of Boron who departed for the once new colonies decades ago.</t>

	<!--TURRETS/WEAPONS DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="300">Designed specifically for the Aquilo, this launcher is the only platform capable of deploying the OTAS Anemoi Cruise Missile.</t>
	<t id="301">Properties: Cruise missile | Guided | Swarm | Target-seeking \nAI Launch Range: 30 km the many unique weapons developed in the isolation of the Shutdown era, the Anemoi Cruise Missile system swiftly gained notoriety among Commonwealth military observers during OTAS's initial wave of strikes against the Argon Federation. \n\nUnlike most comparable Commonwealth missile systems, the Anemoi utilizes an array of advanced passive and active tracking and guidance systems, able to achive effective target locks at ranges of 30km despite the prevalence of signal masking and jamming systems in the modern battlespace. This is paired with a distinctive quad-missile launch salvo that has taken many unprepared targets by surprise and greatly increases the difficulty of achieving effective missile interception.</t>		
	<t id="302">Rather than traditional amplification oscillators and focusing chambers found on standard Commonwealth high-output beam weaponry, the OTAS Phased Array Laser Cannon uses an array of quickly-positionable tuning mirrors to rapidly concentrate and focus energy into a cohesive beam. While the PALC has significantly reduced raw power output and range compared to its peers, the design features much faster turret tracking and a shorter cycle time which lets it rapidly re-engage new targets with near-perfect accuracy, making it a deadly weapon against fighters.</t>	
	<t id="303">\033#95e03b29#XL Turret\033X\ TEMPEST ONLY \nThe Firestorm Artillery is the result of a decades-long OTAS effort to replicate the Terran Point Singularity Projector, infamous for savaging even the high-tech OTAS-supported Argon Navy during the Terran Conflict era. Despite years of research and nigh-unlimited resources poured into the project, OTAS was ultimately forced to conclude that replicating and deploying the Terran technology in a viable manner was impossible due to the unique high-energy power architcture of Terran ships and systems. In the end, an alternative route was chosen- rather than imitate the Point Singularity Projector itself, OTAS would simply aim to replicate the weapon's destructive power.\n\nThus a surprisingly low-tech solution was found: by converting Firestorm torpedo warheads for use in ballistic shells fired from enormous oversized kinetic accelerators, OTAS could field a heavy siege weapon with superb range and devastating destructive potential. However, the design did require several compromises: the sheer size of the turret and munitions handling systems means it is slow to acquire targets and can only be mounted on specially designed hardpoints such as those on Tempest, while the relative sensitivity of the warhead payload enforces a low projectile velocity and further limits its ability to engage small or moving targets.</t>
	<t id="304">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: HEAVY\n\nDeveloped from studying salvaged Terran Matter/Antimatter weapons technology, this fighter-class weapon fires a torrent of small M/AM warheads that can devastate targets in short order. However, the small scale of the warheads causes them to suffer faster payload containment destabilization, resulting in a severely limited effective range.</t>	
	<t id="305">Size: LARGE\n Weapon Class: RAILGUN\n\nA devastating capital-class weapon based on a combination of pre-Shutdown Split kinetic weapons technology and salvaged Terran Matter/Antimatter weapons, the M/AM Mass Driver is regarded as one of the great triumphs of Dark-era OTAS research. Firing large-caliber shells carrying the heaviest and stablest matter/antimatter payload ever developed by the Commonwealth, the weapon delivers devastating firepower with lethal accuracy at long range.</t>	
	<t id="306">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: BOMBER\n\nA modular, on-the-fly-reconfigurable universal launch system capable of loading and firing nearly any self-propelled missile system available throughout the gate network. \n\nOriginally developed by OTAS for their revolutionary Notus bomber, Terran observers were quick to realize the weapon's potential and the Protectorate soon developed their own version- identical in concept and operation, but created using Terran technology. OTAS' comparatively advanced technological base combined with vigorous counter-espionage efforts has thus far kept their version of the design safe from replication by the less sophisticated rival Commonwealth powers.</t>	
	<t id="307">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: BOMBER\n\nThe result of a joint development effort by Split and OTAS scientists to produce a new weapon for the Notus and the newly-introduced Split Wolf, the Cluster Bomb Launcher is a specialized, single-payload variant of the standard Missile Launch Array that fires large volleys of unguided explosive projectiles. Intended to give bombers viable striking power against capital-class targets without being reliant on limited missile ammunition, the weapon is highly effective in it's intended role and is now a common sight among Split bomber forces. However, the wide spread and poor velocity of the projectiles along with a lack of proximity detonation ability renders the system largely ineffective against small craft.</t>
	<t id="308">A sophisticated missile guidance and target tracking system forming a cornerstone of the Anemoi Cruise Missile's multi-faceted targeting package, designed for the Aquilo. \n\nWhile active laser designator systems are an ancient pre-spaceflight technology, simulated combat exercises with the early Aquilo testbeds revealed that the laser designator unit - nominally just a contingency backup system to the more advanced options built into the suite - proved extremely popular with Aquilo crews and the ship performed notably better when the system was enabled than when it was turned off. Additional testing revealed that the cause was twofold: the narrow-band wavelength cycling ability of the laser proved effective at defeating a variety of conventional missile countermeasures, and on several occasions the Aquilo was able to use the visible laser beam to force one opposing ship to take evasive manuevers while using different guidance option to engage a second ship, taking both opponents by surprise.</t>

	<!--SHIP DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="800">Once the linchpin of the OTAS fleet, the Boreas continues to serve as the organization's premier destroyer-class warship. Upon Reactivation the Boreas has undergone significant change to compete with existing destroyer class ships. The modern Boreas is now much more heavily armed and shielded than before while still retaining some of the signature speed.</t>
	<t id="801">Completely redesigned following the Shutdown, the modern Auster retains the rank of a heavily shielded and lethal bomber while still retaining the now S-class fighter size.</t>
	<t id="802">A descendent of the ship that first established "M7M" Missile Frigate type designation, the modern Aquilo honors its lineage with an intimidating array of launch tubes capable of launching the signature Anemoi Cruise Missile, providing massively destructive long-range fire support against capital targets and stations during OTAS fleet actions. \n\nDespite the tremendous power of its main armament, proper usage of the Aquilo necessitates a sizable escort force and strong local battlespace control, as the ship's relatively poor mobility and limited defensive armament leave it highly vulnerable to direct attack despite its typically above-average OTAS shielding.</t>
	<t id="803">The Skiron represented a significant step forward in OTAS corvette design. A further improvement on previous designs, the modern Skiron has evolved into a robust gunboat and is typically seen escorting capital class ships or as anchors in patrol fleets.</t>
	<t id="804">Once nearly abandoned following the seizure of Argon space, the Sirokos "M7M" frigate has had a radical redesign into a modern strike corvette with S-class fighter storage and launching capabilities.</t>
	<t id="805">The modern Solano is a highly advanced scout/interceptor hybrid. Its superb top speed and small size make it well-suited for swift reconnaissance in hostile space, and the above-average firepower packed onto the ship makes it a deadly counter to other scouting vessels, though it must rely on its speed to escape from larger threats.</t>			
	<t id="806">The standard fighter type deployed by OTAS, the Eurus is a well-rounded and capable combatant with respectable firepower and excellent high-speed maneuverability. While it has few truly stand-out features aside from the high top speed, the ship enjoys a general advantage over its Commonwealth peers thanks to the advanced nature of OTAS technologies. The Eurus is a common sight in any location with an OTAS presence, serving on the offensive frontline and enforcing police presence in secured sectors.</t>		
	<t id="807">The Notus bomber was developed by OTAS during the isolation of the Great Dark. Initially just an exploratory testbed attempting to emulate the success of the M7M missile frigate- one of the many OTAS innovations of the pre-shutdown Commonwealth- the Notus performed well in simulations and exercises, promising to provide an immense amount of striking power with the ability to carry and deploy a wide variety of heavy ordnance in its modular side pods. When the gates abruptly reopened and OTAS resumed open hostilities against the Argon Federation, the Notus soon proved its worth and became notorious for savage lightning strikes capable of swiftly crippling Argon capital ships. \n\nSeeing an opportunity in their shared enemy, the Zyarth Patriarchy were quick to make diplomatic overtures towards OTAS, with the aim of procuring the Notus' technology for their own use. This effort culminated in the Split Wolf bomber and numerous improvements to the Notus, as well as new weapons that could take full advantage of the Notus-type ordnance hardpoint. The technology rapidly proliferated through the rest of the gate network, with the other Commonwealth powers and even the Terrans soon fielding their own bomber models- developed through espionage, battlefield salvage, or their own engineering efforts.</t>
	<t id="808">Regarded as one of the most feared heavy fighters pre-Shutdown, OTAS diligently worked to keep the Venti at the pinnacle of lethality. The Venti is able to bring a truly devastating array of weapons to bare on anything deemed an enemy of OTAS.</t>
	<t id="809">OTAS completed a total redesign of the Zephyrus just after the reactivation of local gates. Acknowledging they would require a strike carrier capable of projecting OTAS authority, the redesign maintained the core concept of the ship but brought it into the modern era with the new standardized S-class docking bays.</t>
	<t id="810">Once a common sight in pre-Shutdown OTAS fleets, the venerable Astraeus saw continuous design changes and modifications during the Shutdown-era to fit an evolving combat role as OTAS reshaped its fleets. The modern Astraeus is a capable and versatile escort frigate: fast and reasonably shielded, fitting array of offensive and defensive turrets, and even possessing limited launch facilities for a handful of escort fighters. \n\nThough it lacks any forward-firing main armament, the unconventional shape of the hull and ample turret hardpoints allows the Astraeus to maintain superb fields of fire all around itself, and it is often seen operating ahead or within formations of larger capital ships on anti-fighter picket duty.</t>
	<t id="811">The life force of OTAS and long overshadowed, the Mistral is without a doubt the most important ship in the OTAS fleet. Following The Shutdown and takeover of the local Argon sectors large numbers of Mistrals would be seen transporting vast quantities of supplies across the new OTAS Exclusion Zone.</t>
	<t id="812">Developed in total secrecy pre-Shutdown and unleashed during the OTAS hostile seizure of the local Argon sectors, the Tempest is an extremely formidable battleship even by modern standards. The design saw continual updates, improvements, and iterations during the Great Dark to maintain its ability to engage entire fleets with minimal support, and it is one of the few deployment platforms for the OTAS Firestorm Artillery batteries. \n\nRumors abound that the ship makes use of highly illegal and dangerous AGI technology, though this has never been firmly proven despite intense scrutiny from both Commonwealth rivals and the Terran Protectorate.</t>
	<t id="813">Following their reconnection to the Commonwealth, OTAS quickly identified the immediate requirement for a new and modern construction ship in order for them to be able to expand outward and compete with the other powers. \n\nStolen in the same attack as many other Argon industrial ships, the Vesuvius is a near exact copy of the Mammoth; OTAS having seen little need to spend time and credits to further refine a humble construction vessel.</t>
	<t id="814">Another design stolen from the Federation following OTAS's reconnection, the Genthus is a twin to the Nomad but with several unseen upgrades and improvements. Previously, OTAS had no need for long range or large scale fleet resupplying given their total control on their cluster of systems. Born more out of necessity than ambition, the Genthus is expected to fulfill its role admirably.</t>	
	<t id="815">Despite what the Federation has publicly stated,the Andaman's existence is proof that the rumors of OTAS successfully stealing ship designs was true. A heavily modified and arguably improved variant of the Colossus, OTAS quickly tasked their engineers with "resolving" the issues which they believed Federation engineers were incapable of correcting. Now flaunted openly as if to intentionally incite a hostile response, the Andaman has become a powerful addition to the OTAS fleet.</t>

	<t id="7">An even more dangerous configuration of the Xenon I, the IX possesses a host of enhancements- an expanded array of main battery turrets, overcharged internal generator, and heavily reinforced hull structure. Thankfully, the ships are a rare sight outside of deeply occupied Xenon sectors and do not appear to be a standard combat configuration used in offensive actions, possibly due to the vast amount of resources required to produce one. All confirmed encounters with the type follow the same pattern: a fleet conducting offensive operations against the Xenon gains the upper hand, pushing deep into Xenon territory. When victory against the local branch matrix seems to be at hand, the situation shifts with the sudden appearance of an IX that swiftly swings the balance of power. \n\nMuch of what is known about the IX is sourced from encounters by the Terran Intervention Corps, with the Terran government being uncharacteristically open and cooperative in sharing intelligence regarding the type. Military analysts have attached the "Reclamation" title to these vessels, concluding that they are a reactive, last-ditch attempt by the Xenon to secure certain "core" sectors under threat, by dedicating all remaining available resources to their production in hopes of re-establishing the local presence once the sector is cleared of hostiles. As the ships have been observed seemingly appearing from nowhere even after the destruction of local Xenon shipbuilding facilities, it is theorized that they are assembled under asteroid cover or heavy sensor jamming fields, utilizing the same in-situ bootstrapped self-assembly technology that has been observed in the construction of Xenon stations.</t>

	<t id="300">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: BOMBER\n\nThe Light Plasma Bomb is a standardized, near-universally compatible weapon intended to be fitted to the heavy ordnance hardpoint found on bomber-type attack craft.\n\nA derivative offshoot of the ubiquitous Plasma Cannon technology, the weapon fires a highly unstable ionized plasma mixture held within a transient containment field. Upon impact the projectile loses containment and produces a high-energy flare, causing significant damage to anything unlucky enough to be caught within the sizable blast radius. Though very destructive, the projectiles have an extremely poor velocity and effective range due to containment bleed-off, making the weapon largely ineffective when deployed against anything other than its intended capital-class targets.</t>	
	<t id="301">Size: LARGE\n\nThis modified version of the standard Argon-built Photon Pulse Cannon was developed specifically for use as the primary armament of the Boron Marlin frigate. \n\nThough it uses the same underlying operating principles as the Argon progenitor, the Boron version of the PPC has been re-engineered to fit Boron power architecture and tactical sensibilities, boasting greater engagement distance at the cost of limited gimbal range and incompatibility with non-Boron ship systems.</t> 
	<t id="302">This piece of equipment is used to assist Viper missile frigate captains in maintaining proper distance from their intended targets. \n\nWhile manually operated rangefinding and targeting devices are a primitive solution dating back to pre-spaceflight era, their adoption has been highly effective in curtailing Split captains' tendency to grow bored in their standoff fire support role and demanding that their ship "close with the enemy, so that they may strike them with their blade", by giving them something to do. The additional benefits of slightly reduced target acquisition times and marginally improved terminal guidance are seen as welcome but ultimately unnecessary side effects. </t>	
	<t id="303">A sophisticated target acquisition and tracking suite utilizing a human-in-the-loop advanced long-range recognition system, initially designed for the Kitsune. \n\nThough the early trial versions of the system were fully automated and demonstrated excellent performance, battlefield experience revealed that in the heat of combat, the inability of the crew to directly influence the ship's armament produced a variety of psychological effects that manifested in poor tactical judgement and significantly impaired combat efficiency. By reintroducing the human factor at several critical points of the target engagement process, these issues were eliminated and overall combat effectiveness saw an notable improvement, even in low-pressure trial scenarios.</t>

	<t id="800">A new development and seldom seen outside of Split space, the Cheetah is a light carrier ostensibly built in a bout of cooperation among the Split Free Families as a more specifically tailored version of the Split Panther. However, observers have noted that the Cheetah's unique capabilities are oddly well-suited to the lightning-fast ambush raids carried out by Fallen Families raiders, and the ship is just as commonly seen wearing Fallen Families colors as it is in Free Families livery, leading to a widely-accepted theory that the ship was in fact built to the specifications of an influential Fallen Families warband. \n\nRegardless of the truth of its origins, the Cheetah itself is an extremely capable raider - boasting an exceptionally high top speed along with an L-class turret hardpoint, a very large fighter capacity, and numerous launch tubes to rapidly surprise and overwhelm a target with fighters. However it is much less capable than its peers when it comes under direct threat, having poor shielding and only a small number of M-class defensive turrets. In addition, the Cheetah is fitted with relatively few landing pads, making it slow to recover its fighter complement. Alongside its limited capacity for self-defense against peer targets, this means that Cheetah captains must remain mindful of not only their attack vectors, but also be constantly planning an exit strategy should the tides of battle turn against them.</t>	
	<t id="801">The Chiba E is the Terran refinement of the Pioneers' original converted design. In a rare display of technological acknowledgement, the Terran Protectorate purchased access to the Chiba's design specifications and soon placed an improved version into service. While the design heritage of the Hokkaido hull remains clearly evident, the Chiba E is built to purpose from the keel up; featuring numerous internal modifications and improvements including expanded fighter-handling facilities and dedicated launch tubes, the ship has greatly improved performance in the light carrier role. \n\nIdentical in function to the original, the Chiba E is commonly seen patrolling Terran space, serving as a a base for local policing efforts or as small task force leaders.</t>

	  <!-- S bombers -->
	<t id="810">The Split Wolf bomber is one of the largest and deadliest S-class combat ships, surpassing even the powerful Chimera. Developed with the assistance of OTAS engineers under a diplomatic effort to cooperate against their enemy, the Argon Federation, the Wolf makes use of technologies first pioneered for the OTAS Notus bomber, adapted for the generally lower Commonwealth technology base. Though relatively slow and a large target, the Wolf has a powerful arsenal of weapons fitted to a heavily reinforced hull, and in numbers presents a formidable threat to capital-class targets of any size. \n\nWith the Wolf demonstrating an integration of OTAS and Commonwealth engineering, the technology soon spread through the Gate Network, with other powers fielding their own bomber-type vessels.</t>
	<t id="811">The Terran Falchion bomber is perhaps the most heavily specialized ship in the class. While broadly identical in strategic function as the Notus and other Commonwealth counterparts, the Falchion does not use any version of the Notus' technology, and was developed and built completely from scratch by Terran engineers. \n\nUnlike other bombers, the Falchion carries no secondary armament to accompany the ordnance hardpoints, and is largely reliant on fighter escorts to clear the battlespace. In exchange, the ship presents a very small target profile and possesses robust shielding, maximizing its survivability against its capital sized targets. </t>
	<t id="822">PAR placeholder</t>
	<t id="813">Designed, built, and put into service with staggering and uncharacteristic alacrity by the Argon Federation Navy, the Buster is the result of Argon efforts to swiftly close the capabilities gap posed by the OTAS Notus and Split Wolf bombers. \n\nUnlike many of its peers, the Buster as a combat machine is wholly unremarkable: lacking the configurable multi-missile launchers found on the Notus, backing up it's single bomber-class hardpoint with a pair of conventional light weapons mounts and featuring a singular shield projector, the ship trades individual power for expedience in service and an exceptionally low production cost.\n\nThanks to the Argon Navy's numerous external threats and competing priorities, it has thus far maintained that "the ship you have now is better than a ship you might have next year" and the Buster has remained in service with no replacement in sight despite its various shortcomings, much to the annoyance of its pilots. Many common jokes within Argon Buster squadrons pointedly highlight the attractiveness of the ship's low cost of production and operation to the Argon civilian government, laced with macabre punchlines wondering how many Busters must be destroyed before it becomes economically advantageous to develop an improved ship. However, this same affordability has resulted in the Buster finding a surprisingly successful market among small independent mercenary outfits or private security firms, where the ship represents a very cheap opportunity to augment marketable capabilities.</t>

	<t id="820">A cooperative effort between Boron and Argon engineers, the Marlin is a frigate built with lessons learned from encounters with Split and Xenon forces following the reconnection of Boron space to the wider Commonwealth. Having identified a need for heavier anti-capital firepower than that provided by the larger Ray, the Marlin is designed with a unique (among Boron vessels) primary weapon hardpoint capable of mounting the powerful Argon Photon Pulse Cannon. Coupled with its small size and reduced price compared to a full destroyer, a squadron of Marlins can match the firepower of much larger vessels and overwhelm otherwise superior foes while maintaining cost parity.\n\nBased on a heavily redesigned version of their previous Sturgeon hull, the Marlin represents a surprising breakthrough success for the nascent Stellar Shores Shipping company, providing their first foothold in the highly competitive military procurement market and placing them solidly in line with their older, more established corporate peers.</t>
	<t id="821">Caracal</t>
	<t id="822">Serval</t>
	<t id="823">One of the more unusual ships produced by the Teladi Company, the Cassowary frigate is something of an engineering and marketing oddity. Abruptly released to the market with little fanfare shortly after the launch of the Heron E, critical observers have noted the ship's resemblance to a truncated forward dome section of the larger Heron freighter. The Teladi Company has vehemently denied allegations that the Cassowary is simply a repurposed Heron hull section that suffered structural failure during construction, with one Teladi Company spokesperson being quoted as saying that "The front section did not 'fall off' of anything! If anything, the Cassowary IS the front!". The Teladi Company has since distanced itself from the quoted official and has not acknowledged any requests for clarification.\n\nUnusual appearance notwithstanding, the Cassowary is an uncharacteristically well-armed offering in the Teladi catalogue. Boasting no less than three large turret hardpoints and protected by two large shield projectors, the ship is a superlative standout in the frigate class, though it is notably lacking in point-defense armament compared to its peers and suffers from a significant aft blindspot due to the unique hull layout.</t>
	<t id="824">Faced with the ever-increasingly irritating task of policing Free Families colonial space against progressively more creative threats cooked up by Fallen Families warbands, Zyarth forces found themselves in need of a more powerful rapid response and escort vessel than the ubiquitous Cobras and Dragons that ordinarily formed the backbone of colonial police forces. Initial plans to employ the Rattlesnake in this role were met with great enthusiasm from Split captains, but were denied due to the perceived expense of "wasting" a frontline combat vessel on police duty. Unexpectedly, it was Family Kritt which approached the Patriarch with a new design to fulfill the role - the Adder frigate. \n\nMounting a large and conspicuous turret battery primarily consisting of anti-fighter weaponry, the Adder is an impressively optimized design - visually impressive, fast, well-armed, and most importantly, much cheaper to manufacture than the Rattlesnake. Among its peers, the Adder boasts a massive array of medium turrets matched with a characteristically strong Split-built hull and powerful engines, providing Zyarth colonial police with a robust fleet leader when engaging ships such as the Free Families Cheetah. The ship has also become a common sight in Split frontline formations, where its high speed and powerful screening armament provides an excellent complement to the immense raw firepower of the Rattlesnake, allowing Split forces to continue to operate even with heavy enemy fighter presence.</t>
	  <!-- TMs -->
	<t id="830">A class of ship that fell out of favour during the Shutdown-Era, TM-class Military Transports serve dual roles as well-defended couriers of sensitive cargo and as cost-effective solutions for low-intensity patrol and police duties.\n\nThough they were largely unneeded during the isolation of the Gate Shutdown, the class was reintroduced following the Reconnection to alleviate the increased pressure placed on military forces by the rise in inter-faction tensions and Xenon activity, replacing frontline-capable combat units in second-line roles. Traditionally built on a modified civilian transport hull, TM-class vessels sacrifice a large portion of their cargo capacity in exchange for handling and servicing equipment to support a small wing of fighters. Rather than traditional docking pads, TMs are fitted with short range graviton tractor beam arrays to hold docked fighters in place, using a standard service umbilical to transfer crew between vessels rather than maintaining an "open-space" atmospheric envelope. Though this allows TMs to carry a large number of parasite fighters for their size, the lack of internal storage bays means that the externally-docked fighters are vulnerable to damage and the ship can only realistically support as many fighters as it can dock. \n\nThe Split-built Crocodile is one of the smallest ships in the class, though it still manages to land a wing of four heavy fighters and features the aggressive speed common to Split designs.</t>

Though lightly armed, like its transporter ancestor the Helianthus boasts improved shielding and excellent mobility.</t>

Though using the same grav-harness docking technology as most TMs, the unique hull form and docking arrangement of the Pleco allows it to carry no less than six parasite fighters, giving it a distinct edge in offensive capabilities compared to its peers, despite its poor speed. Coupled with the characteristically sturdy Boron shielding, the Pleco makes for a far more dangerous opponent than its spindly appearance and unassuming name might suggest.</t>

	<t id="842">One of the largest ships found in Terran space, the Pioneer-built Kagawa is a freighter vessel of truly mammoth proportions. Rivaling the Terran Asgard battleship in sheer size and mass, the Kagawa features one of the largest cargo-handling capacities found anywhere in the Gate Network.\n\nFollowing the reconnection of the Althes and Megnir jumpgates, and the ensuing massive military and humanitarian efforts to secure those sectors against Xenon assault, the engineers of the Pioneer Initiative were tasked with preparing an ultraheavy transport vessel capable of ferrying enormous amounts of humanitarian supplies or necessary war materiel that might be needed if a route was discovered to the final lost colony of Aldrin. The advent of Project Genesis terraforming efforts expedited development of the Kagawa, with the sheer scale of resources demanded by the terraforming process promising a steady demand for such large transports.</t>	
	<t id="843">A ship with a legacy dating to the early years of the Pioneer Initiative, the Pata was born from the Pioneers' need to carefully shepherd all available resources. Derived from the core of the Bolo miner, the Pata is fitted with a larger engine array and a trio of tractor beam projector turrets that allowed the early Pioneers to first clear large debris fields to make navigation safer, and later to recover useful debris and wreckage for salvage and reprocessing. \n\nThough the faction is no longer as desperately strapped for resources, the conservationist spirit has persisted in the form of more organized salvage operations utilizing purpose-built Patas which constitute a small but culturally important segment of the economy, and the ship's highly distinctive silhouette can be spotted throughout Pioneer space and the bordering regions.</t>
	<t id="844">The Pioneer-built Bulwark is a highly specialized ship for a very specific purpose. Designed to provide small-scale logistics and repair support for stranded civilian vessels and damaged satellite networks, the Bulwark is fitted with a scaled-up version of the standard space suit repair beam and features a unique storage bay to carry a number of disassembled and flat-packed repair drones, though the ship cannot deploy them for usage by itself. In concert with an onboard engineering module capable of assembling or disassembling repair drones in-situ for transfer to a larger ship, the ship's small size belies its remarkable drone carrying capacity, allowing a single Bulwark to effectively get stranded or damaged ships back under way.</t>
	<t id="845">Developed and employed by the Riptide Rakers as a stopgap measure to assist large ships which were crippled by the Tide but could be saved, the Douala is a small and simple utility vessel suitable for use the confined space around Tidebreak station. A minimalist design intended to only be deployed over short distances in the hectic periods between Tides, the Douala is sluggish, lightly shielded, and completely unarmed save for a single repair beam. The ship's primary defining feature is a set of bulky storage units capable of housing a small handful of repair drones for transfer to a larger ship, as the Douala lacks the size or facilities to deploy them itself.</t>

	<t id="850">As the first highly-anticipated combat-line product launched by the post-shutdown reconsolidated Jonferson Space Dynamics Division, the Mk3 Centaur is a dramatic return to the ship's roots as a fast, aggressive corvette-class striker. Designed in a bid to produce a ship capable of matching or exceeding the capabilities of the venerable Terran Katana, the ship boasts a formidable array of forward weaponry, good all-around turret coverage and fighter-like agility, though this comes at the cost of a light-duty hull structure and somewhat mediocre overall protection. \n\nWith the newly-reformed company holding a tenuous financial position, it was a deliberate decision by Jonferco designers to recall the classic Argon design in a bid for a knockout market entrance. Though the Centaur fell somewhat short of the impossibly lofty expectations set upon it by Jonferco executive leadership, the ship proved a commercial and military success, being well liked by its users and earning a particular popularity with the semi-independent Special Action Task Forces of the Argon and Antigone navies.</t>

	<t id="11001">The product of a joint Argon-Teladi venture to produce a new generation of cheap defence drone following the Gate Reconnection, the Universal Standard-Armaments Semi-Autonomous Fighter Drone - more commonly referred to as the Commonwealth Standard defence drone, or simply the Standard - is a massive commercial and military success that can be found both in service and available for sale throughout every corner of settled space. \n\nThough the design has begun to significantly show its age in the modern battlespace and brings very little in the way of individual combat power, decades of design maturation and manufacturing refinements have driven the cost of the Standard down to practically nothing, letting even the most cash-strapped freighter captain freely deploy them in bulk as disposable countermeasures against pirate attack. This has ensured the continued popularity of the Standard despite its perceived obsolescence in frontline military use.</t>	
	<t id="1101">{20202,601} {20101,100401}(Xenon Defence Drone)</t>
	<t id="11011">Little is known about the Xenon defence drone beyond the proven fact that it is tactically superior to any of its counterparts. Beyond being larger, more robust and having better armament, Xenon AGI systems also ensure the drone is smarter and meaner than any other drone system. A swarm of Xenon drones can swiftly bring down an underprepared foe of any size and present a formidable obstacle when contesting battlespace control of Xenon-occupied systems.</t>	
	<t id="1102">Keris Defence Drone(Terran)</t>
	<t id="11021">The modern incarnation of Terran Keris defence drone is a powerful and advanced semiautomonous weapons system. Though somewhat slower than its Commonwealth counterparts, the Keris presents a reduced target profile and possesses superior armament in the form of a standard Terran Pulse Cannon.</t>	
	<t id="1103">Krill Defence Drone(Boron)</t>
	<t id="11031">Designed in a bid to reduce casualty risk to fighter pilots, the Krill defense drone is a very agile drone armed with a single Ion Gatling. \n\nAccording to Boron fleet doctrine, correct usage of the Krill drone in a coordinated fleet action sees it deployed in large numbers alongside manned fighters, using its physical presence to distract enemy fire and the engine-disrupting properties of the Ion Gatling to pull apart enemy formations, thus allowing crewed fighters to deliver decisive tactical strikes in relative safety.</t>	
	<t id="1104">Skink Defence Drone(Split)</t>
	<t id="11041">A highly conventional application of Split combat philosophy, the Split-designed Skink defence drone is extremely fast and mounts a deadly Tau Accelerator as the main weapon system, giving it an unexpected edge in combat when facing larger targets.</t>	
	<t id="1105">Cupid Defence Drone(Paranid)</t>
	<t id="11051">As much a product of cultural dogma as one of military necessity, the Paranid Cupid defence drone was initially designed by the Holy Order to both provide their forces with a combat advantage and to free their captains from the perceived shame of relying on the heretical Standard drone. The Holy Order enjoyed a brief period of drone superiority before the design was acquired by the Godrealm, which swiftly adopted the system and began to field their own copy. \n\nArmed with a scaled-down version of the Paranid Railgun system, the Cupid gives Paranid forces a unique form of offensive support.</t>

	<!--TURRETS/WEAPONS DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="300">\033#95e03b29#L Turret\033X\ \nUnable to easily gain possession of high-tech capital ship weapons, pirate engineers designed the Incendiary Bomb Launcher as an easily producible alternative. With the name being in use for nearly a century, each iteration of the IBL is based on the design of a contemporary weapon and shares little in common with its predecessor, aside from the basic mode of operation and effect on target. The modern IBL is essentially just a massively scaled up and mildly deconstructed Plasma Cannon, hurling massive balls of high-energy plasma that destabilize and explode on impact. This explosion deals significant damage across a wide blast radius and momentarily leaves behind a burning reside that can damage the hulls of shielded targets, though the unstable nature of the projectile somewhat limits the IBL's effective range compared to similarly sized weapons.\n\nCuriously, neither of the IBL's secondary effects are intentional- in a bid to reduce the power demands of the weapon, a variety of features dedicated to safety and reliability were stripped from the Plasma Cannon design, though the negative effects of such a move are clearly of little interest to the pirates.</t>	
	<t id="301">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: BOMBER\n\nThe Incendiary Bomb Mortar is a miniaturized version of capital-sized Incendiary Bomb Launcher. Just like the larger counterpart, the IBM throws unstable plasma projectiles that explode on impact and briefly leave a burning residue that can damage the hull of a shielded vessel. While it offers a remarkable amount of firepower for its size, the lack of a capital-grade power supply drastically limits the projectile's maximum range and velocity.</t>	  
	<t id="302">As its name suggests, the Yaki Burst Ray turret incorporates the same phased-wavelength technology found on the standard fixed-mount Burst Ray. Much like the progenitor technology, the Burst Ray turret deals extra damage against exposed hull and surface components, and can partially bypass active shield layers, though this comes at the cost of a reduction in maximum effective range- a tradeoff deemed necessary in order to enhance their raiders' ability to swiftly overwhelm and disable targets when making forays through hostile space.</t>
	<t id="303">The Yaki Rail Slugger turret is a straightfoward modification, mounting a Paranid-designed Rail Slugger onto a medium-class turret mount. Though it has extremely poor tracking capability, the weapon boasts a best-in-class effective range and lethally fast projectiles, giving Yaki raiders an extremely effective armament to harrass targets while on the offensive or covering rear arcs to deter pursuers.</t>

	<!--SHIP DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="800">Scale Plate pirates have long been rumored offer a premium to employ Teladi builders for remote jobs, only to commandeer their vessels after the work is complete. While the majority of these captured construction ships are swiftly broken up for scrap to turn a quick credit and recoup costs, recent shifts in internal culture of the Scale Plate Pact have resulted in a different fate for some of the vessels. The growing trend of organization and cooperation among Pact pirates has led to the emergence of pirate warlords, commanding of large fleets of roaming marauders seeking to leave their mark on the galactic stage. In an apparent bid to recall the old legends of pre-shutdown pirate might, some captured Albatross builders have resurfaced as massive pirate scavenger-carriers, heavily modified but clearly recognizable, serving as flagships for the most successful pirate warlords. Dubbed the Galleon, these ad-hoc warships are a rare sight despite the proliferation of the Pact- a testament to the difficulty of procuring such a vessel given the unruly nature of pirate warbands and the significantly limited resources available to the pirates. \n\nWith its primary purpose being to visually demonstrate the power of their warlord-captains, the Galleon eschews defensive measures, with only modest shielding for its class and no point defense emplacements. In exchange, the ship boasts one of the heaviest armaments of any Commonwealth vessel: a formidable battery of 12 large turrets, often fitted with an eclectic loadout of whatever was on hand at the time, supported by abundant internal hangar space and numerous small ship landing pads. Beyond it's own capabilities, a Galleon is also inevitably accompanied by a full warband of pirates- motley swarms containing any number of attending vessels of all sizes. The arrival of a Galleon-led Warlord fleet presents a grave threat to any civilian or military asset in the system, and those few examples that are successfully wrested away from pirate control are jealously guarded trophies. </t>
	<t id="801">Another revived design borne of the increasing cooperation within the Scale Plate Pact, the Blastclaw bomber is a remarkably capable ship and is a common sight in among larger pirate flotillas, both escorting larger vessels and operating as an independent strike wing. \n\nThough rather slow, the ship is well-shielded and features a heavily reinforced hull. However, the true strength of the bomber lies in the Incendiary Bomb Mortar mounted under the cockpit, capable of rapidly blasting away exposed surface elements and weakening shielded hulls. Even a single Blastclaw poses a deadly threat to poorly defended freighters, while a sufficient number of them can even challenge and disarm a destroyer, leaving it disabled and vulnerable to boarding actions undertaken by larger ships.</t>	
	<t id="802">One of the larger threats in regular use by the Scale Plate Pact, the Brigantine is a heavily armed capital ship that can pose a significant threat even to military forces. Found almost anywhere that Scale Plate pirates operate and fulfilling any role demanded of it from solo raider to warband leader, the ship's pervasive presence in pirate fleets is owed primarily to its relative ease of acquisition. As many observers have concluded from it's appearance, the Brigantine is cobbled together by pirate shipwrights using the hull sections of Teladi auxiliary ships and carriers- scavenged from battlefield wrecks, decommissioned hulks and even the occasional captured prize. As with the Galleon, rumors abound of the Scale Plate Pact employing less overt means of acquiring these hulls through independent purchasers or unscrupulous Teladi officials, though the Teladi Company vehemently denies the rumors as slander and the Pact remains characteristically cagey with its secrets. \n\nIn the battlespace, the Brigantine employs a typically mismatched grab bag of weaponry and shielding, with the pirates making up what they lack in sophistication and planning with enthusiasm and sheer volume of fire. A handful of docking pads and launch tubes- remnants of the original ships that make up the hull- allows the Brigantine to deploy and support a small wing of fighters or drones to bolster its already-formidable firepower, while cavernous cargo capacity alleviates any need to be picky with plundered loot. Even the sheer imposing size of the vessel offers another weapon in the form of a menacing intimidation factor against civilian freighters. However, the design has numerous flaws as well- the nature of the Brigantine's construction leaves it with a weak hull structure for a ship of its size, a problem made worse by the relatively limited shielding and subpar speed. The substantial armament is also widely distributed across the hull, leaving few blind spots but in turn greatly degrading the ship's ability to concentrate fire on a target.</t>
	<t id="803">CARRACK DESCR</t>
	<t id="804">Another of the Scale Plate Pact's homegrown designs, the Marauder corvette was first created in an act of desperation by a mechanically inclined Pact captain whose Minotaur Raider had been crippled in a raid gone awry. Though he managed to limp back to a hidden freeport, survival was only the first of his problems. Financially destitute, with a shattered ship and a crew on the verge of desertion, the captain - one Iljorgawas Minanoros Ioannis XII - noticed that although the central section of his Minotaur was little more than twisted scrap, the critical forward control and the aft machinery sections were still mostly intact. Struck by a flash of inspiration, he managed to cajole a little more faith from his crew and spent the next several days cutting out the damaged central section of his ship and reconnecting the two remaining portions. A few modifications later, he and his crew once again headed out in what would become the template design for the Marauder. \n\nAs the smallest medium-class ship currently found in the Gate Network, the Marauder specializes in attacking smaller foes while running from larger ones with its good agility and comparatively high speed. A varied collection of armaments - a pair of M-class fixed mounts, a single M-class turret, and four S-class fixed mounts thrown in for good measure - gives the ship good striking power against small transporters or enemy fighters, while the surprisingly capacious cargo storage for its size allows SCA freebooters to haul home their spoils. In exchange, the poor shielding, somewhat questionable hull strength, and anemic armament for its weight class leaves the ship with unfavorable odds when facing other corvettes or even a particularly ornery heavy fighter pilot. Nonetheless, its low operating costs and cheap construction price(often made cheaper through the use of written-off Minotaurs, like the original) ensure its place as a mainstay among the Scale Plate Pact pirates.</t>

Even without a habitable planet - consisting instead of several nebulae, an asteroid field, and a colossal gas giant hosting several orbital cities - the system continues to flourish. Its position as a critical crossroads within the Federation anchors the system as an economic community that is perhaps more closely intertwined with the network's trade routes than any other.</replace>

Many traders are seen frequently traversing the system, ferrying their wares between the ever growing Argon Federation, in the hopes of turning an honest profit.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares their equitable and entrepreneurial spirit. Pilots are frequently harassed by pirates, and it is not uncommon for trade ships to vanish completely. Despite calls for improved security, only parts of the system have been claimed and are actively patrolled; it is simply too big a task to weed out the criminal elements inhabiting the further reaches of the system. Ultimately, though, the risk posed by outlaws does not outweigh the convenience of travel, and potential losses are counted as an acceptable cost of doing business.</replace>

Because of this, pirate raids are incredibly risky, but they also promise great rewards. These incursions usually happen within the blink of an eye, and can be overwhelming to the victims of the pirate raids.\n\nDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, before the Paranid people descended into vicious civil war, Trinity Sanctum has slowly become a home to many groups looking to re-establish contact between systems.

While these stories are hyperbolic and apocryphal, there is a kernel of truth to them. Wretched Skies (same as {20005,9002}) has always been used as a dump site by Split families, and is home to several Split prison colonies, housing disloyal family members. Most of the convicts are awaiting execution, which is carried out swiftly and efficiently by ejection into space.\n\nThe extraordinary body count is further compounded by occasional clashes between Split and Paranid forces.

High above this settlement, a breathable atmosphere was established using a particle layer, which also protects the surface from the Sun's radiation and keeps its temperature steady.\n\nThe space around Mars is also of vital importance to the Terran military. Previously home to the USC, the military industry in this sector is responsible for some of the most respected ship designs in the Terran fleet. These days it is still the base of operations for the Terran Protectorate's war efforts, and since it is the outermost sector with access restrictions, it also serves as a barrier between those regions of Sol that are accessible to the majority, and the more well-guarded, gated sectors surrounding Earth.</replace>

Its remote location was also the reason why Neptune(same as {20004,1100011}) was chosen as the location for the third gate to be created by Terran engineers. Its intended function was to re-establish contact with Terran colonies outside the Sol system, in an attempt to maintain some influence over Commonwealth politics.\n\nAs a result of hosting this additional gate, the sector also came to serve as the logical point of origin for the Pioneer Initiative, which was sent out further to develop Brennan's Triumph and the outer rim of Sol, and which would eventually evolve into the Segaris Pioneers.\n\nFollowing recent events this connection would instead be rerouted to the original connection to the Althes system which also prompted the Protectorate to authorize the construction of additional ship fabrication facilities in Neptune to ensure the safety and security of Sol from all outside threats.</replace>

When the Xenon were pushed out of the system, Brennan's Triumph became a haven for piracy - most notably the organised slave trade - much to the dismay of the Argon Federation, who repeatedly attempted to put an end to this criminal activity. While the Argon Federation failed to regain control of the system, the Jump Gate shutdown would prove disastrous for the resident pirate groups. Since their economy relied exclusively on raiding neighbouring system, it completely collapsed when those systems became inaccessible.\n\nWhen the Terran government established a new connection between Neptune and Brennan's Triumph, they sent the Pioneer Initiative to colonise this system.

The system's exports would find their way to the furthest reaches of the commonwealth. Unobstructed, streamlined trade was of such importance that scientists carried out a project to move a Jump Gate away from an inconveniently located belt of asteroids. This was done to optimise travel times, exemplifying Boron ingenuity and their commitment to not only further scientific progress, but also to reach out to the network's peoples as best they could.\n\nUnfortunately for its residents, the system suffered gravely from being disconnected. While initially silicon was plentiful, the system lacked many of the other materials that were required to maintain a healthy economy. As the years passed the deposits of silicon began to deplete. With no alternative source, the system now threatens to become truly barren. Some of the more spiritually-minded inhabitants cannot help but wonder whether the administrator who initially named the system had some sort of prophetic insight into what could come to pass.\n\nToday, many Boron have abandoned space for the relative comfort of the nearby planet of Menehune(Menehune same as {20005,9066}). The Provinces Adrift administration attempted to ship planet-bound resources into orbit, to aid the failing economy, but it became painfully clear that they were missing the infrastructure and manpower for even such a comparatively trivial task. Transporting resources off-planet is becoming a more and more unattractive proposition with each passing day, as more Boron give up on their aspirations of interstellar habitation.

Neptune was chosen as the location for the new Jump Gate, its distance to Earth being a compromise; close enough for trade, but far enough not to become a major safety risk. The connection served people from both sides, allowing for economic, scientific and cultural exchange after centuries of separation. Like the rest of the gate network, this connection was lost during the Jump Gate shutdown.\n\nEven with the Second Terraformer War on hold and the Jump Gate shutdown in progress, Terran relations with the Community of Planets were still poor at best. This led the Terran High Command to set up a covert operation to re-establish a connection using the Neptune Gate. The Terrans chose to connect the Gate to an old Gate in the Brennan's Triumph system, originally destroyed during the First Terraformer War. After moving the alien Jump Gate to the far outskirts of Brennan's Triumph and repairing it, the Terrans managed to establish a connection and keep it secret for several years. After the Jump Gate in the Asteroid Belt shut down, the Neptune Gate prevented Sol from being fully disconnected from the Gate network once again. With the help of an independent entrepreneur, the Terrans connected the outskirts of Brennan's Triumph with its core, establishing their hegemony over the system.\n\nHowever, after recent events brought the system of Althes back to the Network, the Protectorate rerouted the connection from Brennan's Triumph which was now firmly established under the Segaris Pioneer Initiative.</replace>
