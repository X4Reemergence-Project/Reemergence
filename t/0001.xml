	<t id="01">{20005,7046} {20401,2}(Oort Cloud Beta)</t>
	<t id="02">Following reports of unknown vessels and sporadic disappearances in the outer Oort Cloud, the Protectorate reactivated the trans-orbital accelerator leading to Oort Cloud Beta and established a sentry presence. Generally considered to be the edge of Terran-controlled Sol, Oort Cloud Beta is chiefly remarkable for being the sector where Beryll Syndicate operations in Terran space were finally cornered and hunted to extinction, and is officially home to little more than the occasional patrol or intrepid prospector. However, the increase in traffic accompanying the reactivation of the accelerator has led to an uptick in unknown vessel sightings, and rumours abound that the Protectorate is preparing a major military operation to establish a permanent presence and ensure that any survivors of the Beryll purge or whatever else may be lurking out in the dark are destroyed for good.</t>		
	<t id="03">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,1001}{20404,1} (Matrix #01)</t>
	<t id="04">Found on the very outer edges of the Oort Cloud beyond an accelerator pair that was built in an effort to explore the interstellar space, this sector is now home to a previously undetected Xenon Core Matrix. Believed to have originated from replicant-capable Xenon technology carried by Beryll survivors that fled beyond Oort Cloud Beta, this Xenon Matrix has evidently never been disconnected from what is now known as Branch 9, displaying all the standard Xenon technologies and designs that are recognizable across the Gate Network. While it is unknown how they maintained contact during Sol's isolation from the Gate Network, the most commonly accepted theory postulates that the Beryll survivors possessed a partially-functioning Jump Beacon, which allowed the Xenon to maintain their Branch Connection for a time after disposing of their would-be Beryll captors. How this Matrix has survived so long without a reliable source of energy is a mystery, though this makes it highly vulnerable to inevitable extermination by Terran forces.</t>	
	<t id="05">{20005,7012} {20401,2}(Mars Beta)</t>
	<t id="06">Established due to a change in Protectorate doctrine focused on increasing Sol's strategic depth and resilience, the Mars Beta sector encompasses a resource-rich region created by the orbital degradation of Phobos and bolstered through active asteroid capture from the Asteroid Belt conducted by deepspace expeditions ranging well outside the established Asteroid Belt sector. Previously overlooked due to the richness of Asteroid Belt, the increasing pressure on that sector as the first line of defense against hostile incursion has led the Protectorate to seek alternative concentrations of raw resources in the event that access to Outer Sol is lost.</t>	
	<t id="07">{20005,7017} {20401,2}(Mercury Beta)</t>
	<t id="08">Another resource extraction sector established following a shift in Protectorate defensive doctrine, Mercury Beta is much closer to the small planet and contains a large silicon-rich debris field. This field is the result of a controversial program of capturing potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and trans-solar objects and directing them into close proximity with Mercury, where they are broken up by gravitational interaction with Sol itself and settle into a close orbit. \n\nThe long-running program, first initiated to protect Earth from potential impactors, has drawn heavy and continuous criticism for the dangers that the debris field and transiting captured bodies pose to the crucial energy cell production facilities of the Mercury sector. Nonetheless, the Protectorate's insistence on maintaining the program has over time built up a massive quantity of raw material both in the regional space and fallen to the planet's surface, which now provides an important strategic reserve in the otherwise resource-poor Inner Sol region.</t>		
	<t id="09">Althes</t>
	<t id="10">One of the several Terran Lost Colonies, Althes once formed the gateway between Sol and her other colonies. Connected to Sol via a Terran-constructed gate in the Neptune sector, Althes provided further access to the other lost colonies of Megnir, Segaris, and eventually Aldrin. When the gates shut down, Althes remained connected to neighboring Megnir through one gate, while another realigned with a Xenon Core Matrix, plunging the two colonies into a bitter war for survival with the equally isolated Xenon Matrix. The reconnection of the gates brought little relief, as the isolated Matrix synchronized with the rest of Branch-9 and evolved far past its previous capabilities, forcing the beleaguered colonists to withdraw to Megnir or face complete destruction. </t>		
	<t id="11">Megnir</t>
	<t id="12">Another colony once thought to have been lost, the initial rediscovery of Megnir, followed by Segaris and Aldrin, were momentous occasions subsequently cut short by the Gate Shutdown. Remaining connected to neighbouring Althes, Megnir found itself fighting desperately against the Xenon advance alongside her sister colony during the Isolation. Though the brunt of the fighting was borne by Althes, Megnir supplied much of the men and materiel, with the colonies understanding that this was a do or die moment for both of them. It was thanks to Megnir's shipyard - initially built by the Sol government, heavily used during the Isolation, and decommissioned following induction into the Pioneers Initiative due to the immense amount of acculumated wear and tear - that the colonies were able to avoid total destruction after the loss of Althes.\n\nContact with the colony was restored when a Gate reopened and connected the two-colonies-turned-one to the third colony of Segaris, now under the flag of the Segaris Pioneers. Though Megnir was initially slated for absorption into the Protectorate itself, the Pioneers successfully made the case that the Colonies had stood together before, and deserved the right to stand together again. The continued defense of Megnir is now undertaken by the combined Pioneer forces with occasional assistance by the Terran Intervention Corps, and it is the hope of many among the system's inhabitants to reclaim Althes and make the colonies whole again.</t>		
	<t id="13">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,4}{20404,8}(Matrix #48)</t>
	<t id="14">Once connected to a major Xenon sector only identified as "Core 023", the Xenon of this sector were the scourge of the Lost Colonies during the Gate Shutdown. When the gate connections began to fail, the Xenon moved extensive assets into Matrix #48, apparently foreseeing the need for the Matrix to stand alone. \n\nRemaining connected to Althes and Megnir while isolated, the local Xenon fought a deadly and protracted conflict against the neighbouring Terran Colonies, making slow but steady progress against the desperate defenders. The reopening of the gates allowed Matrix 48 to resynchronize with the Branch-9 network, catapulting its technological evolution overnight and enabling it to completely force the Terran defenders out of Althes. Though stopped at the Megnir-Althes Gate by the spirited defense of the colonists and later pushed further back by the combined forces of the Pioneers and Terran Intervention Corps, Matrix #48 remains a persistent lurking threat and source of continuing concern for the Segaris Pioneers.</t>	
	<t id="15">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,7}{20404,9}{20403,1}(Matrix #79A)</t>
	<t id="16">Even more of an enigma than Matrix #79B, this sector mirrors all of the complete unknowns as its counterpart and is confirmed to have also never been encountered before in the network. The Alliance of the Word conducted further research into the structures and discovered that the ones here pre-date those in Matrix #79B yet gave no insights as to their origin or purpose.</t>
	<t id="17">{20005,1041}(Power Circle)</t>
	<t id="18">Sometime before the last Xenon conflict the planet "Shipfall" was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Argon industrial coloney. Some effort had been made to re-establish the colony but had been restricted to mining and agriculture. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the sector once again fell apart as it was unable to support itself and there are currently no identified inhabitants.</t>						
	<t id="19">{20005,1041} {20402,1}(Power Circle I)</t>
	<t id="20">Once the initial area of space utilized pre-Shutdown, now that Power Circle is again connected to the Argon, abeit the Antigone Republic now. As the Republic was already founded by colonist who overcame great adversities and became a thriving nation there are already many plans to not just reclaim the system but properly recolonize it.</t>			
	<t id="21">{20005,1041} {20402,3}(Power Circle III)</t>
	<t id="22">Prior to the Shutdown the Federation completed the local superhighway leading much closer to the surface of the planet "Shipfall" so the fledgling new settlements could be better resupplied. Immense effort was taken to relocate the Gate which once connected to Three Worlds as well to give the venture every opportunity of success. Sadly now it seems that effort was completely wasted as not only did the colony completely die out but now that Gate connects to the enigmatic Matrix #79A and #79B.</t>			
	<t id="23">Teladi Gain</t>
	<t id="24">The favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector came under Teladi management who reimagined it into a destination of recreation. The Bliss Place produced the narcotic spaceweed which drew in dreamers, artists, and neo-philosophers of all races. \n\nDuring the Shutdown the sector's priorities dramatically shifted and the leisures of recreation were quickly abandoned for the harsh reality of survival. Now reconnected, the Teladi are once again set on restoring the sector to its pre-Shutdown condition.</t>			
	<t id="25">Herron's Nebula</t>
	<t id="26">A mineral rich system famed across space for its residents' vast consumption of space fuel and the semi-legal bootlegging which procured it. Following the Gates' reactivation Federation scouts were estatic to have rediscovered the sector but dishearten to have found it abandoned with little evidence as to the fate of the fabled workers. \n\nOnce Herron's Nebula was an Argon core sector which connected directly to Argon Prime but following the reactivations it has shifted outward yet remains close at hand.</t>			
	<t id="27">Montalaar</t>
	<t id="28">An old mining outpost founded near the red gas giant "Hitt's Eye", Montalaar had been an Argon settlement in the areas of space claimed following the Xenon conflict. \n\nTrading, food, and materials installations had been constructed in service to the private mining outfits looking to exploit new minerals but following the Shutdown these facilities were slowly decommissioned to keep the orbital station host to a small colony from falling apart. Now that the sector is reconnected, all survivors have been relocated to Argon Prime and the Federation has already begun to reintegrate the sector.</t>			
	<t id="29">Split Fire</t>
	<t id="30">Once home to much of the illicit trade in the known Network with a thriving industry of counterfeit Paranid jewellery. Pirates and smugglers traded with all races and operated as brokers for sensitive or illegal deals between the species. \n\nJust prior to the Shutdown rumors of Xenon activity began but the sector very shortly disconnected afterwards. Now Federation scouts have identified it as a Xenon Matrix and found no evidence of any organic life nor organic installations.</t>			
	<t id="31">Dark Waters</t>
	<t id="32">This system was rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. Heavily policed, any potentially hostile would be swiftly destroyed despite the sector itself being little more than a trading outpost. \n\nFollowing the Shutdown the entire sector was evacuated to the still connected nearby Boron sectors.</t>			
	<t id="33">Mists of Elysium</t>
	<t id="34">The planet Elysium is described as a peaceful paradise world filled with lush plant life but with lowlands filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day yet the Boron were unconcerned by this as they remained within their deep-sea homes. \n\nNow reconnected, no Boron could be found on the planet and the thick mist has extended to covering the seas as well.</t>			
	<t id="35">Depths of Silence</t>
	<t id="36">The heavily guarded secret of Dark Waters, Depths of Silence was formerly home to a massive scientific black site established by the Royal Boron Military to pioneer new technologies that could give the Boron people any advantage over their enemies. \n\nOnce filled with sprawling, high-tech complexes that investigated everything from creating advanced ion-hybrid weaponry to increasing the nutrient density of BoFu, the sector is now completely overrun by a Kha'ak infestation of unknown origin. What became of the heavy security force and the research they protected remains unknown.</t>			
	<t id="37">Light Waters</t>
	<t id="38">Following the discovery of the North gate in Shore of Infinity, this sector was founded and colonized by the Boron. Once a mixture of food production and solar power plants, the system grew to importance to the nearby colonies. The habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size with the surface being mostly covered in water. \n\nFollowing the shutdown the local Boron retreated deep into the planet's vast ocean and abandoning the stations which fell into disrepair before ultimately burning up in the atmosphere.</t>			
	<t id="39">Shining Currents</t>
	<t id="40">Founded as a food production center to aid the continual growth of the Boron Queendom, the name comes from the reflection of mercury from the ocean of primary planet's moon. \n\nAs the Gates began to flicker off the Boron evacuated from Dark Waters took refuge here but they seem to have not survived the Great Collapse.</t>				
	<t id="41">Shore of Infinity</t>
	<t id="42">Leased by the Paranid to the Boron who once had a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants, Shore of Infinity saw limited trade between the two races and helped keep relations between them amicable. While the Paranid provided protection, the Boron lent their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranids' efforts in cyber biology. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown the sector became one of the few surviving Boron colonies, albeit just barely. Those Paranid that remained became erratic being cut off from their leaders and left in an ill-fated exodus.</t>		
	<t id="43">Reservoir of Tranquillity</t>
	<t id="44">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system was a source of strategic power for the Boron. Once a border colony to a local Split family, it acted as a crossroads for the nearby Boron settlements which made it particularly important for passing traders. Guarded by a lone destroyer and escorts, pirate activity was minimal and the Split had been occupied elsewhere. \n\nOnce reconnected the Alliance of the Word found a few scattered Split wrecks and salvaged them for information. Unfortunately there was litte of value other than the markings of Family Rhy.</t>			
	<t id="45">Duke's Domain</t>
	<t id="46">A highly agriculturally developed system, Duke's Domain provided much of the Soja Beans forming the basis of the Paranid diet. The highly ionised water of the systme's planet contains rare organic minerals which greatly improve the flavour of beans nurtured in it. \n\nThe system suffered particularly heavy losses in the last Xenon conflict and following the initial gate shutdowns it suffered even further as local Paranid could not cope with being disconnected nor had the resources to maintain their stations.</t>
	<t id="47">{20005,3038}(Perpetual Sin)</t>
	<t id="48">For a long time an insignificant system seeing only occasional Kha'ak skirmishes, it grew to being proof that those considered to be beyond redemption can be brought back onto the path. On the third day, of the third month, after having fallen into disgrace and being banished here, a Paranid scout managed to triangulate the location of a jumpgate leading to a then-unknown system. \n\nRegaining the respect of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, this scout was sent to explore the system but was never seen again. \n\nThe discovery of this active gate, in close proximity to the Second Duchy, was seen as furher evidence that the Paranid Empire was destined for greatness and helped PerpetualSin itself to gain some favour.</t>			
	<t id="49">{20005,3038} {20402,1}(Perpetual Sin I)</t>
	<t id="50">Once initially the original location of the Southern gate leading to Duke's Citadel prior to the Paranid moving it even further South. Perpetual Sin I was established to further study the gate of legend and prior to the shutdown Paranid scientists discovered yet another gate floating lifeless and in a decaying orbit at the very extreme edge of the solar system. While there are no indications of their success the trapped Paranid appear to have been making attempts to reactivate these gates.</t>
	<t id="51">{20005,3038} {20402,3}(Perpetual Sin III)</t>
	<t id="52">A refuge for the Paranid who wish to seek the same redemption as the fabled scout of old, Perpetual Sin III has been designated as the site of their ultimate potential salvation and is the only acceptable place for these banished Paranid to gather within the Holy Order without risk of being executed. \n\nAs has became tradition, on the third day, of the third month, of this third system; disgraced Paranid assemble to find either renewed purpose and redemption or further disgrace and damnation. Those who return to the holy path are given this singular chance and should they fail in their duties again will be executed on sight.</t>	
	<t id="53">Sanctum Verge</t>
	<t id="54">A newly discovered system, Sanctum Verge has been selected by the reclusive Pontifex of the Holy Order as a new holy site of the three-dimensionality and on the cusp of prophetic wonder. \n\nWhile the endgoals of the Pontifex are unknown it is rumoured that the sector is to be built up to further support nearby Pontifex's Claim as it is on the frontline against the Godrealm. Yet another rumour is that the Holy Order had actually found something of immense value in the sector and are now trying to hide the truth.</t>						
	<t id="55">Pontifex' Seclusion</t>
	<t id="56">The last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors, this sector was famed for its lack of hospitality and said to be a retreat for the Pontifex should he need to leave the main sectors and be isolated for any reason. Once deep within the Second Duchy it was hard to reach due to the pirate activity along the way but following the reactivation it has since been absorbed into the Holy Order of the Pontifex.</t>			
	<t id="57">Unholy Descent</t>
	<t id="58">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonist of not following the Paranid religion. Now once again connected it appears Xhar'Bar claimed the lives of those heretical colonists, depriving the Holy Order the chance to purge them in the holy name of their Pontifex.</t>			
	<t id="59">Cathedral of Xaar</t>
	<t id="60">A system which had just been discovered and claimed by the Paranid prior to the beginning of the Collapse, Cathedral of Xaar was slated to become a far flung temple in service to the holy three-dimensionality. These ideas were dashed when the sector was once again thrown into the dark and those Paranid with it. Now unveiled once again, the Godrealm seeks to reinvigorate the old plans of old.</t>			
	<t id="61">Clarity's End</t>
	<t id="62">Long-range scout patrols from Cardinal's Domain ventured upon this sector at the same time as the arrival of a mining expedition from Aladna Hill. The resulting tensions did little but re-open old wounds. Few Paranid would deny the opportunity to fan the flames of a war brought over from the old world. \n\nHaving now been reconnected to Sacred Relic, the Alliance of the Word seeks to redeem the sector from its hostile past and one day be able to rename it to Clarity's Dawn.</t>			
	<t id="63">Desecrated Skies</t>
	<t id="64">Ravaged by conflict, greed, and now the Xenon; this sector remains in turmoil. The internal power-struggles between pirate factions meant that travelling through the sector was extremely dangerous. The Paranid's attempts to cleanse the sector were frequent and forceful but the pirates always returned. \n\nJust prior to the Shutdown The Beryll were rumoured to have started supporting one of the pirate factions which are likely where the local Xenon originated from.</t>	
	<t id="65">Perdition's End</t>
	<t id="66">Perdition's flames brought fear to the hearts of both Argon and Paranid, and fury and rage from both sides have quenched the firestorm that burned through this sector. \n\nPerdition's end may soon be near, but the fires of conquest still burn brightly.</t>		
	<t id="67">Ket's Reckoning</t>
	<t id="68">When an unknown gate in Windfall III activated, a nearby Riptide Raker smuggler named Ket Rova who was on the run from Syndicate enforcers took a risk and became the first known individual to see the sector, followed very shortly after by his pursuer. \n\nWhile the sector was initially calm it quickly became lethal when a large swarm of Kha'ak quickly converged onto the now active gate. While Ket esaped back to Windfall III he brought back with him a reckoning for the Syndicate; a Kha'ak invasion.</t>		
	<t id="69">Unused</t>	
	<t id="70">Unused</t>
	<t id="71">{20005,3020}(Xaar's Belt)</t>
	<t id="72">Following the reconnection of both Clarity's End and Perdition's End, Godrealm of the Paranid sent scouts to delve deeper into the new unknown and found this previously unidentified sector, believing it to be a sign from the holy three-dimensionality and immediately dispatched ships to establish three sets of superhighways.</t>			
	<t id="73">{20005,3020} {20402,1}(Xaar's Belt I)</t>
	<t id="74">Situated between the planet's two moons, Xaar's Belt I is rich in methane and acts as the anchor in the superhighway connections as the scouts identified the, at the time, inactive gate which now connects to Desecrated Skies.</t>			
	<t id="75">{20005,3020} {20402,2}(Xaar's Belt II)</t>
	<t id="76">The sector's asteroid belt is the result of the second moon's slow decay caused by the planet's gravity pulling it down, which ultimately will result in the moon's impact of the planet and destruction of any potential planetary colony.</t>			
	<t id="77">{20005,3020} {20402,3}(Xaar's Belt III)</t>	
	<t id="78">When the Paranid scouts first entered the system via the Clarity's End gate they were met with the brilliance of the local sun's blue corona and began surveying the first moon while identifying while probing for any other potential gates before they made contact with the other Paranid scouts from Perdition's End.</t>	
	<t id="79">The Shallows</t>
	<t id="80">Originally deemed to be impossible to settle due to deeply drifting nebulae; The Shallows remained largely unpopulated. With recent solar flares having helped to clear the nebulae, building had continued at a greater pace. Both Boron and Split forces contested the area, eager to regain lost ground. \n\nDuring the Shutdown this sector was one of few known to have not regressed and is one of the Split sectors which stayed connected to each other and the Boron within the Contested Zone. The Shallows is now at a crossroads against their equally isolated Boron adversaries and has been host to several skirmishes in recent years.</t>	
	<t id="81">{20005,5044}(Family Than)</t>
	<t id="82">The seat of political power for the Split within the "Warlord's Dominion". Prior to the Shutdown, Patriarch Than was simply the director of the Strong Arms corporation but following this he seized power in the now completely cutoff Split sectors which now included this previously unknown sector. \n\nWhile all real power was still centered within Thyn's Excavation via the Strong Arms Corporation, Patriarch Than was eager to further validate his new title and laid claim to the entire system. However following reconnection to the Network and under the threats of Patriach Zyarth, Patriach Than fell in line and, officially, is subservient to Zyarth. In reality the Strong Arms Corporation still has completely authority within the "Warlord's Dominion"</t>			
	<t id="83">{20005,5044} {20402,1}(Family Than I)</t>
	<t id="84">The capital of Family Than and political seat of power within the "Warlord's Dominion", this sector is arguably the second most important Split sector because of the crucial ore mined from the asteroid belt. \n\nOnce reconnected to the Gate Network, Patriarch Zyarth demanded Family Than yield to his authority or risk the same fate as the formally Free Families. While officially subservient, Patriach Than is still the director of the Strong Arms Corporation and has refused to degrade his status.</t>			
	<t id="85">{20005,5044} {20402,3}(Family Than III)</t>
	<t id="86">Pushed further out from the planet's orbit, Family Than III is the location of a previously inactive gate which has only very recently reconnected to the wider Network via Unholy Descent and by extension, the zealots of the Holy Order of the Pontifex. \n\nThe sole source of ore for the Split within the "Warlord's Dominion", this system is very busy with industrial ships traversing acrossing the sector to keep the ever demanding Strong Arm war machine running.</t>
	<t id="87">Thyn's Abyss</t>
	<t id="88">This deep space system was about as close as the Split got to a civilian operation and once produced food and other organic products while mines on the asteroids spread across the system. Due to the lack of any real military presence the sector was quickly overwhelmed by Xenon forces before they withdrew back to Matrix #472D just before the Great Shutdown.</t>		
	<t id="89">Thyn's Excavation</t>
	<t id="90">The location of the Stong Arms Headquarters, Thyn's Excavation provided funds and resources for the ongoing conflict in the local area against not just the nearby Boron but across the entire old Network and continues to be very well guarded by the aptly named corporation. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown, Strong Arms took complete control of the local Split sectors in what became known as the "Warlord's Dominion" ruled by the self appointed Patriarch Than, the director the Strong Arms Corporation.</t>
	<t id="91">{20005,9008}(Blue Horizon)</t>	
	<t id="92">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector was officially designated US 18-16 and was the location of a disappointing mineral survey conducted by the Boron Royal Research Institute. Despite the poor results efforts continued to probe the sector for anything of value as it was reconnected to the "Enduring Shores" of the Atreus Corporation who deployed their only Superhighway following a review of the previous survey and the discovery that the results were intentionally fabricated for unknown purposes and obscured the fact that the sector was extremely mineral rich. \n\nHome to most of what was the "Enduring Shores" mining operations, Blue Horizon is as critical as ever against the local Split and Xenon threat.</t>			
	<t id="93">{20005,9008} {20402,1}(Blue Horizon I)</t>	
	<t id="94">The original core of the sector, Blue Horizon I is where the erroneous survey was conducted which stated that the sector was devoid of mineral value despite the presense of a significant asteroid field. \n\nAs such, Blue Horizon I is a vital source of ore for the Atreus Corporation's operation in the "Enduring Shores" and is generally well guarded against any potential Split incursion from the "Warlord's Dominion".</t>				
	<t id="95">{20005,9008} {20402,4}(Blue Horizon IV)</t>
	<t id="96">Settled as a result of the Atreus Corporation's construction of the Superhighway, Blue Horizon IV is abundant in both methane and silicon, further proof that the Boron Royal Research Institue's mineral survey was a complete lie. \n\nSituated further in to the Blue Horizon sector, it is less guarded than its companion and is directly connected to Queen's Harbour. However following the recent reconnection to the Network and the previously inactive gate to Great Trench now online and showing concerning signs of Xenon, the Atreus Corporation has begun to divert newly supplied Queendom military assets to better protect this vital system.</t>	
	<t id="97">Great Trench</t>	
	<t id="98">This Boron mining colony was once a busy hub of both industry and as a refit and supply center for Boron ships working in the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids made the Boron who lived here harder and more cynical than those in the home systems, \n\nOnce isolated, the colony very quickly fell apart as they were unable to produce their own food and quickly burned through any stockpiles they had gathered.</t>
	<t id="99">Queen's Harbour</t>	
	<t id="100">Once specialising in food and power storage technology, Queen's Harbour is the location of the original Atreus Headquarters that was lost when the Gates began to shut down. While the remnants of the corporation reestablished themselves in Ocean of Fantasy before collapsing under the stewartship of the Provinces Adrift, Atreus proper became the driving force in the "Enduring Shores" of Queen's Harbour, Queen's Retribution, and the formally colonized Blue Horizon. \n\nNow that connection has been reestablished these sectors immediately rejoined the Queendom but are still formally run by the Atreus Corporation due to the vast distance between them and Kingdom's End.</t>
	<t id="101">Queen's Retribution</t>
	<t id="102">Formally a Boron core sector specialising in technological and military output, Queen's Retribution was established to strike out against a growing conflict with the Split. During the Great Shutdown the new Boron colonies were completely disconnected from the wider network and instead were locked into a bitter conflict with the equally trapped "Warlord's Dominion" Split. \n\nWhile originally the home of the local Boron Shipyard, Queen's Retribution found itself now on the frontline in the local conflict. As such, all vital infrastructure was moved to the more secure Queen's Harbour and brought completely under the control of the Atreus Corporation.</t>
	<t id="103">{20005,8001} {20005,8003}{20404,4}{20404,7}{20404,2}{20403,4}(Matrix #472D)</t>
	<t id="104">Once a Split mining outpost, one day a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by the Argon security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a radioactive hell and access to the system was restricted. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon superweapon was to blame. \n\nPrior to the Shutdown pilots who passed through this system once reported a large ship but those reports ceased and if the ship existed, its presence and location was never known and the Xenon presence in the system has only further increased following The Collapse.</t>
	<t id="105">{20005,9038}(Ocracoke's Storm)</t>
	<t id="106">This bleak region was once home to the Yaki pirate faction. While dozens of rumours swirled regarding the sector prior to The Shutdown, little else was ever confirmed and only speculations were left.</t>				
	<t id="107">{20005,9038} {20402,1}(Ocracoke's Storm I)</t>
	<t id="108">Prior to the deactivation of the Gates the Yaki were responsible for the bold theft of a pair of, at the time, experimental superhighways which were used to expand the sector significantly while moving the Southern gate further South. There were also rumours that the Yaki were responsible for the theft of Accelerators destined for Lucky Planets but no proof was discovered before The Collapse.</t>			
	<t id="109">{20005,9038} {20402,2}(Ocracoke's Storm II)</t>
	<t id="110">The enigmatic Southern sector of Ocracoke's Storm, the local gate was once connected to Senator's Badlands and had been heavily guarded by the Yaki's strongest ships. It now remains as silent as its Northern counterpart, showing no indications of the fate to these Yaki and continuing to conceal their secrets.</t>
	<t id="111">{20005,6025}(Shadows of Giants)</t>
	<t id="112">An enigma to the Alliance of the Word, Shadows of Giants is both completely unknown and had never been charted yet is home to a fully operational, albeit old, superhighway of unknown origin and unknown builder.</t>			
	<t id="113">{20005,6025} {20402,6}(Shadows of Giants VI)</t>
	<t id="114">"Shrouded in the darkness and adrift in the endless void this system bares witness to the Shadows of Giants."</t>			
	<t id="115">{20005,6025} {20402,7} (Shadows of Giants VII)</t>
	<t id="116">"Bathed in the light and tether to the Great Giant, this system holds the truth of its magnificence."</t>	
	<t id="117">Bala Gi's Joy</t>
	<t id="118">Once deep in unclaimed space, Bala Gi's Joy is home to a cratered moon, used as a scrapyard for the wreckage of the many ship disabled and then stripped by the pirates of the past following ambushing and attack traveling ships. These same pirates were then trapped following the Shutdown and forced to survive on what little was left in the system following the years of stealing everything of value from the corpses of the dead. \n\nThey did not survive long.</t>
	<t id="119">Blue Profit</t>
	<t id="120">Once a busy and lucrative Teladi system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Blue Profit was most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Teladi factory workers which combined Teladi reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Argon and Teladi percussion instruments. "Teladi Blues" is still appreciated by many sentient species post-Shutdown. \n\nNow the sector's space remains silent, the economy having completely collapsed and nearly every ship no longer spaceworthy.</t>			
	<t id="121">PTNI Headquarters</t>
	<t id="122">Once home to the NMMC corporation, formerly knowns as PTNI, a corporation which controlled the supply of the rare mineral Nividium and had also been making efforts to reform its policies following accusations of illegal activity. While the corporation's name change they agreed to leave the sector's identification the same citing historical reasons. \n\nOnce producing high-quality weapons for the Teladi as-well-as other general resources for the two planets in this sector the allegations of illegal activities appear to have been true; the corporation's assets having been destroyed, their HQ's shattered husk floating adrift, and a massive Xenon presence which appeared to have evolved from The Beryll strain.</t>			
	<t id="123">The Vault</t>
	<t id="124">While the Teladi Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector would have choosen to disagree. The Vault was a system hard to reach by normal means and contained nothing but high tech stations. \n\nHome to the Teladi Company's main research facility and it always tried to improve upon existing technology. While expected to expand and greatly improve the Company's assets, The Vault was lost to the Shutdown and all hopes and aspirations were lost with it when the colonists were unable to sustain their own survival.</t>			
	<t id="125">Recovered Capital</t>
	<t id="126">Once one of nearly a dozen pirate controlled sectors it was renamed to Recovered Capital during the Shutdown as a large Teladi fleet was stranded in sector and forced into a prolonged war against the equally isolated pirates. \n\nInitially things went very poorly for the Teladi before it became obvious that the pirates could not sustain the conflict beyond the opening phases and were ultimately overwhelmed. \n\nFollowing reconnection the Teladi Company has invested in the sector as a potential trade hub up for the far flung Godrealm and Holy Order enclaves.</t>
	<t id="127">{20005,9002}(Wretched Skies)</t>
	<t id="128">Those who entered this region of Wretched Skies did so for two reasons. To kill or be killed. Split Executor squads routinely patroled, laying in wait for pilots to be lured into the sector before ripping them from their ships.</t>			
	<t id="129">{20005,9002} {20402,2}(Wretched Skies II)</t>
	<t id="130">Nicknamed "The Meatgrinder", this region of Wretched Skies is what remained of the sector's tortured past and is where disgraced Paranid pilots duel to the death with Split pilots to settle debts, all sanctioned by Patriarch Zyarth and tolerated by the Godrealm.</t>			
	<t id="131">{20005,9002} {20402,7}(Wretched Skies VII)</t>
	<t id="132">A no man's land devoid of any value but strategic positioning and the superhighways established by the Teladi; Wretched Skies VII stands as a crossroad between the Teladi, the Godrealm, and the Holy Order which ensures the Paranid Civil war will rage here as well.</t>			
	<t id="133">{20005,3027} {20402,1}(Duke's Vision I)</t>
	<t id="134">The last great Duke once visited this sector and after a few short hours he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he awoke he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known to be the Kha'ak. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Paranid Prime in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had them. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow them. \n\nSeemingly aware of the sector's imminent reconnection, the Holy Order of the Pontifex sent a massive fleet to reclaim it, denying the relatively weak Godrealm enclave in Wretched Skies the honor of bearing holy witness to it first.</t>	
	<t id="135">{20005,3027} {20402,2}(Duke's Vision II)</t>
	<t id="136">Following the Holy Order of the Pontifex's reclamation of Duke's Vision the Pontifex decreed that the three-dimensionality prevented the construction of either a shipyard or wharf in the holy system. As this would leave the new colony completely isolated and in a very vulnerable state it was divined that it would be acceptable within the three-dimensionality to establish an Accelerator to the very edges of the holy system and begin construction there.</t>	
	<t id="137">LooMankStrat's Legacy</t>
	<t id="138">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through the system. Subsequently many years of archaeology and recovery were undertaken with assistance of the Argon. \n\nAfter the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in but the jump into the system did not go as planned and was ambushed by pirates. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed and the pirates had planted a large minefield with the intention of capturing other ships. \n\nThis plan backfired and resulted in most of the pirates being destroyed themselves as they began to flee from the sector during the Shutdown, a twisted irony of fates.</t>
	<t id="139">Danna's Chance</t>
	<t id="140">This lawless system was the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants had made a fortune trading the illicit goods while many more were not so fortunate. \n\nDuring The Shutdown it would seem those local pirates banded together and became quite a formidable organization which kept a firm grip on control and managing the resources which were available. Since reconnection they accepted an invitation to join the Scale Plate Pact and have since received significant economic boost to their operations.</t>
	<t id="141">{20005,1034} {20401,1}(Legend's Home Alpha)</t>
	<t id="142">Prior to the Great Shutdown this sector simply did not exist on navigation systems with any rumors ruthlessly squashed until OTAS was ready for the sector to be made public. A center for high tech research and development, Legend's Home is the beating heart of OTAS's power. \n\nFollowing the beginning of hostilities with the Federation and then post-Shutdown, OTAS launched multiple invasions into the still connected Argon colonies and created the OTAS Exclusion Zone which would evolve into the semi-representative government currently in place.</t>
	<t id="143">{20005,1034} {20401,2}(Legend's Home Beta)</t>
	<t id="144">Even further into the Legend's Home area, pre-Shutdown OTAS had just finished construction of the local Trans-Orbital Accelerator which ultimately was activated following their military seizure of the Argon colonies. \n\nAs the sector has been protected behind Legend's Home Alpha, OTAS saw no need to build orbital assets and occupy the sector. However as the gates have begun to reactivate OTAS scientists had begun to detect potentially dangerous spacial anomalies at the far edges of the solar system which has led to not just a large military presence but also a significant investment in the previously neglected orbital assets. </t>
	<t id="145">Akeela's Beacon</t>
	<t id="146">The four great stars which grace this sector were created following the tragic but noble sacrifice of Akeela Hartnell. Her last will was for the Argon Federation to govern the new system and make it a safe haven for all traders. \n\nHowever, this dream was crushed shortly before the Great Shutdown when the OTAS corporation invaded and occupied the system to deprive the remaining Argon colonies of vital sources of energy. Initially this occupation was justified as a necessary step towards securing the well-being of the system's population but post-Shutdown OTAS launched a full invasion of the now isolated Argon systems.</t>
	<t id="147">Aladna Hill</t>
	<t id="148">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war, Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. Following the OTAS invasion of Akeela's Beacon the Argon Federation began to amass military assets with the goal of reclaiming the system and bring the corporation to justice. \n\nPost-Shutdown these forces were obliterated by OTAS with the system swiftly falling under their occupation and established as the next sector in the expanding OTAS corporate sphere of influence.</t>
	<t id="149">Light of Heart</t>
	<t id="150">Once the source of ships and equipment for the Argon settlements claimed following the conclussion of the last Xenon war. Following the initial OTAS invasion all efforts were made to building military assets for the counterattack. Unfortunately the Great Shutdown ruined this plan by isolating these systems from vital supplies and OTAS swiftly occupied this sector as well. \n\nSince the integration of the Argon colonies all ship producing facilities were dismattled and concentrated to Legend's Home as a precaution for any potential rebellions. Now the sector sits at a crossroads within the reconnected network and has become host to a significant OTAS military presence.</t>
	<t id="151">Moo-Kye's Revenge</t>
	<t id="152">A rogue sector once on the main trade lane between the new and old sectors of the Paranid Empire, the sector is now nearly devoid of all signs of previous occupation. The pirates who once fought to seize power appear to have attempted to flee the sector, leaving no traces behind as to their final fates. \n\nFollowing the reactivation of the Gates, OTAS has begun to prepare for the integration of Moo-Kye's Revenge as an important buffer to not only the Teladi but also the Xenon threat emerging from the ruins of PTNI Headquarters.</t>
	<t id="153">Mines of Fortune</t>
	<t id="154">Once the largest Teladi mining operation in history following the Teladi discovering and retrofitting abandoned space stations set into mineral-rich asteroids. The vast richness of the sector would be of no consolation to those left behind following its complete isolation as there was no infrastructure in place to refine the raw ore and silicon into useable products. It appears that the entire sector collapsed, unable to provide power and food to the doomed residents. \n\nCuriously the previously retrofitted mining stations are absent from the sector, their fates unknown.</t>		
	<t id="155">Zyarth's Stand</t>
	<t id="156">Originally little more than a desolate fallback for Family Zyarth once they had been cut off and trapped behind the Xenon, Zyarth's Stand became home to a Split Equipment Dock and the remaining Zyarth forces prior to the Great Shutdown yet even these gates immediately began to flickering following Family Zyarth's total assault against the Xenon. Now reconnected to Zyarth's Dominion, Patriarch Zyarth is eager to reclaim the system and fully integrate it into his new empire.</t>
	<t id="167">Zyarth's Fall</t>
	<t id="158">Originally believed to be the lost Twisted Skies sector when Family Zyarth's scouts began surveying the sector what they found utterly baffled them; drifting silently are the shattered remains of hundreds of Split and Xenon warships. Following salvaging operations it was discovered that the massive Split fleet was the combined forces of Patriarch Rhonkar on a warpath through Xenon forces post-Shutdown. The sector was named Zyarth's Fall as it was both the fall of Rhonkar and the fall of Patriarch Zyarth's hope to reconnect to Twisted Skies.</t>
	<t id="169">Elena's Fortune</t>
	<t id="160">After the Kha'ak attack on President's End the decision was made to bolster the defense of the Argon home systems. The Kha'ak's attack had decimated the pirate forces and allowed the sector to be reclaimed and fortified. Once the system's gates deactivated all of the Federation's plans fell apart and the sector quickly fell back into anarchy and disorder.</t>
	<t id="161">Nyana's Hideout</t>
	<t id="162">Named after the Argon heroine and Goner priestess Nyana Gunne, great-grandaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. Prior to the Great Shutdown the sector had fallen on hard times, hardening the people which served them well in the isolation. Following the Gates' reactivating, Nyana's Hideout connected to the still isolated Argon sectors near the newly formed empire of Patriarch Zyarth and became a shelter for refugees fleeing the frequent slaver raids.</t>
	<t id="163">Interworlds</t>
	<t id="164">Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food to the rest of the Argon Federation, Interworlds expanded to include more high tech stations and products. Once home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, they were not present in the system during the Great Shutdown. What did remain was unable to maintain the stations and slowly they were decommissioned to maintain the supply of food.</t>	
	<t id="165">Wastelands</t>
	<t id="166">Once named Light of Hope until the Xenon attacked many years ago and it was clear that the patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using whatever transport ships were available. A large force of four Titan class Destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with full fighter wings were dispatched to escort the fleeing transports but were overwhelmed by a Xenon fleet with only the civilian ships and a lone destroyer, the Challenger, escaping.\n\nThree years later a joint Argon-Boron force reclaimed the sector and recolonization began. Unfortunately the Great Shutdown once again thwarted this sector's progress and what had been established has fallen into complete disrepair and the surviving colonists eking out a meager existence.</t>	
	<t id="167">Ghinn's Escape</t>
	<t id="168">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further into the area it once connected to, this Split colony was once heavily guarded and a large manufacturer of surveillance equipment and defensive weapons allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. Members of both Families Tkr and Njy were often found in this sector given its close proximity to their space and even saw some skirmishes between them following Family Njy's invasion and occupation of Family Tkr's territory as a result of the Dragon Incident. \n\nFollowing the Great Shutdown this colony completely collapsed and was entirely isolated for decades. The surviving Split families are only just now learning of Patriarch Zyarth's aggression while the sector itself has become a hub for the Fallen Families as they have bolster their ranks with the inhabitants of Ghinn's Escape.</t>

	<t id="181">Spaceweed Grove</t>
	<t id="182">Pre-Shutdown the Teladi had been expanding their influence into the sector with aspirations to take control from the local pirates but were met with fierce resistence which only led to an even more protracted conflict. Now that the gates have reactivated Teladi scouts have so far only found the debris of both Teladi and pirate forces along with the shattered remains of old stations with uncomfirmed reports that the other gate is also active.</t>			
	<t id="183">Shadow's End</t>	
	<t id="184">A previously hidden sector locked behind the OTAS Headquarters of Legend's Home, this sector has since come into its own during the Great Shutdown. Despite the close proximity and abundance of mineral resources, this was the last sector to be incorporated into the OTAS Corporation's holdings as it was not a threat to their security and no local facilities were required. \n\nSince being added, OTAS has expanded their exploitation of the rich resources to fuel their ever growing demand and infrastructure developments while also relocating several high-tech facilities.</t>	
	<t id="185">Tebathimanckatt's Legacy</t>	
	<t id="186">A dim, unpopulated sector along the Paranid border region, Tebathimanckatt's Legacy saw only cursory resource surveys when its jumpgate connection opened from Pious Mists IV, with the Godrealm being preoccupied with reconsolidating its holdings as the gate system began to awaken. This attitude changed following the discovery of the breakaway Holy Order and their heretic Pontifex, which coincided with a flurry of rumors that the sector's name was more than symbolic and that hidden somewhere within were artifacts of great power once held by Admiral Tebathimanckatt himself. \n\nThough these artifacts never materialized despite an intense search by private citizens and Godrealm-affiliated forces alike, the discovery of the jumpgate connecting to Perpetual Sin III saw the system's status skyrocket from quiet Godrealm backwater to a critical strategic avenue and second war front. Forming a potential path to strike at their enemy's interior regions, achieving military control over the sector became a high priority for both factions.</t>

	<t id="100">OTAS</t>
	<t id="101">The Optimised Technology, Armaments and Shielding Corporation, commonly known as OTAS, is a omnicorporation specialized in the design and manufacture of advanced spaceships heaquartered in Legend's Home. In the pre-Shutdown era, OTAS technologies and ships were highly advanced, often leading the cutting edge of Commonwealth scientific advancement, granting the corporation a prominent position on the political starscape of the old Commonweath of Planets.\n\nJust prior to the Great Collapse, OTAS launched an attack on Akeela's Beacon in an escalatory response to the passing of certain industry regulations by the Argon Federation. Seen as an act of terrorism by the Argon, the resulting Argon military response was cut short by Gate Shutdown. While the exact history of the period is lost to the chaos of the Great Dark, it is clear that the Argon response failed to bring OTAS to heel and the corporation now holds full administrative and military control of the formerly Argon sectors in their local region. \n\nHaving evolved beyond a simple technologies corporation, the massive OTAS commercial enterprise now operates as a fully independent star nation. Featuring locally appointed representatives from each controlled sector sitting on the board of directors and a functional state apparatus that earns generally favourable public sentiment, any scars of the hostile takeover have seemingly faded from memory.</t>
	<t id="102">While very much still human, and thus biologically indistinguishable from Argon citizens, the citizens of the OTAS corporation-state have developed culturally into a distinct pseudo-corporate society during their isolation. Following the reconnection, OTAS citizens have come to be seen by much of the Commonwealth as a mixture of both the Argon and Terrans in ambition, technology, and temperament. Only time will tell if they continue to carve their own path or are ultimately brought back into the fold.</t>

	<!--SHIP DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="800">Once the linchpin of the OTAS fleet, the Boreas continues to serve as the organization's premier destroyer-class warship. Upon Reactivation the Boreas has undergone significant change to compete with existing destroyer class ships. The modern Boreas is now much more heavily armed and shielded than before while still retaining some of the signature speed.</t>
	<t id="801">Completely redesigned following the Shutdown, the modern Auster retains the rank of a heavily shielded and lethal bomber while still retaining the now S-class fighter size.</t>
	<t id="802">A descendent of the ship that first establised "M7M" Missile Frigate type designation, the modern Aquilo honors its lineage with an intimidating array of launch tubes capable of launching the signature Anemoi Cruise Missile, providing massively destructive long-range fire support against capital targets and stations during OTAS fleet actions. \n\nDespite the tremendous power of its main armament, proper usage of the Aquilo necessitates a sizable escort force and strong local battlespace control, as the ship's relatively poor mobility and limited defensive armament leave it highly vulnerable to direct attack despite its typically above-average OTAS shielding.</t>
	<t id="803">The Skiron represented a significant step forward in OTAS corvette design. A further improvement on previous designs, the modern Skiron has evolved into a robust gunboat and is typically seen escorting capital class ships or as anchors in patrol fleets.</t>
	<t id="804">Once nearly abandoned following the seizure of Argon space, the Sirokos "M7M" frigate has had a radical redesign into a modern strike corvette with S-class fighter storage and launching capabilities.</t>
	<t id="805">The modern Solano is a highly advanced scout/interceptor hybrid. Its superb top speed and small size make it well-suited for swift reconnaisance in hostile space, and the above-average firepower packed onto the ship makes it a deadly counter to other scouting vessels, though it must rely on its speed to escape from larger threats.</t>			
	<t id="806">The standard fighter type deployed by OTAS, the Eurus is a well-rounded and capable combatant with respectable firepower and excellent high-speed manueverability. While it has few truly stand-out features aside from the high top speed, the ship enjoys a general advantage over its Commonwealth peers thanks to the advanced nature of OTAS technologies. The Eurus is a common sight in any location with an OTAS presence, serving on the offensive frontline and enforcing police presence in secured sectors.</t>		
	<t id="807">The Notus bomber was developed by OTAS during the isolation of the Great Dark. Initially just an exploratory testbed attempting to emulate the success of the M7M missile frigate- one of the many OTAS innovations of the pre-shutdown Commonwealth- the Notus performed well in simulations and exercises, promising to provide an immense amount of striking power with the ability to carry and deploy a wide variety of heavy ordnance in its modular side pods. When the gates abruptly reopened and OTAS resumed open hostilities against the Argon Federation, the Notus soon proved its worth and became notorious for savage lightning strikes capable of swiftly crippling Argon capital ships. \n\nSeeing an opportunity in their shared enemy, the Zyarth Patriarchy were quick to make diplomatic overtures towards OTAS, with the aim of procuring the Notus' technology for their own use. This effort culminated in the Split Wolf bomber and numerous improvements to the Notus, as well as new weapons that could take full advantage of the Notus-type ordnance hardpoint. The technology rapidly proliferated through the rest of the gate network, with the other Commonwealth powers and even the Terrans soon fielding their own bomber models- developed through espionage, battlefield salvage, or their own engineering efforts.</t>
	<t id="808">Regarded as one of the most fear heavy fighters pre-Shutdown, OTAS as diligently worked to keep the Venti at the pinnacle of lethality. The Venti is able to bring a truly devastating array of weapons to bare on anything deemed an enemy of OTAS.</t>
	<t id="809">OTAS completed a total redesign of the Zephyrus just after to the reactivation of local gates. Acknowledging they would require a strike carrier capable of projecting OTAS authority, the redesign maintained the core concept of the ship but brought it into the modern era with the new standardized S-class docking bays.</t>
	<t id="810">Once a common sight in pre-Shutdown OTAS fleets, the venerable Astraeus saw continuous design changes and modifications during the Shutdown-era to fit an evolving combat role as OTAS reshaped its fleets. The modern Astraeus is a capable and versatile escort frigate: fast and reasonably shielded, fitting array of offensive and defensive turrets, and even possessing limited launch facilities for a handful of escort fighters. \n\nThough it lacks any forward-firing main armament, the unconventional shape of the hull and ample turret hardpoints allows the Astraeus to maintain surperb fields of fire all around itself, and it is often seen operating ahead or within formations of larger capital ships on anti-fighter picket duty.</t>
	<t id="811">The life force of OTAS and long overshadowed, the Mistral is without a doubt the most important ship in the OTAS fleet. Following The Shutdown and takeover of the local Argon sectors large numbers of Mistrals would be seen transporting vast quantities of supplies across the new OTAS Exclusion Zone.</t>
	<t id="812">Developed in total secrecy pre-Shutdown and unleashed during the OTAS hostile seizure of the local Argon sectors, the Tempest is an extremely formidable battleship even by modern standards. The design saw continual updates, improvements, and iterations during the Great Dark to maintain its ability to engage entire fleets with minimal support, and it is one of the few deployment platforms for the OTAS Firestorm Artillery batteries. \n\nRumors abound that the ship makes use of highly illegal and dangerous AGI technology, though this has never been firmly proven despite intense scrutiny from both Commonwealth rivals and the Terran Protectorate.</t>
	<t id="813">Following their reconnection to the Commonwealth, OTAS quickly identified the immediate requirement for a new and modern construction ship in order for them to be able to expand outward and compete with the other powers. \n\nStolen in the same attack as many other Argon industrial ships, the Vesuvius is a near exact copy of the Mammoth; OTAS having seen little need to spend time and credits to further refine a humble construction vessel.</t>
	<t id="814">Another design stolen from the Federation following OTAS's reconnection, the Genthus is a twin to the Nomad but with several unseen upgrades and improvements. Previously, OTAS had no need for long range or largescale fleet resuppling given their total control on their cluster of systems. Born more out of necessity than ambition, the Genthus is expected to fufill its role admirably.</t>	
	<t id="815">Despite what the Federation has publicly stated,the Andaman's existence is proof that the rumors of OTAS successfully stealing ship designs was true. A heavily modified and arguably improved variant of the Colossus, OTAS quickly tasked their engineers with "resolving" the issues which they believed Federation engineers were incapable of correcting. Now flaunted openly as if to intentionally incite a hostile response, the Andaman has become a powerful addition to the OTAS fleet.</t>

	<t id="7">An even more dangerous configuration of the Xenon I, the IX possesses a host of enhancements- an expanded array of main battery turrets, overcharged internal generator, and heavily reinforced hull structure. Thankfully, the ships are a rare sight outside of deeply occupied Xenon sectors and do not appear to be a standard combat configuration used in offensive actions, possibly due to the vast amount of resources required to produce one. All confirmed encounters with the type follow the same pattern: a fleet conducting offensive operations against the Xenon gains the upper hand, pushing deep into Xenon territory. When victory against the local branch matrix seems to be at hand, the situation shifts with the sudden appearance of an IX that swiftly swings the balance of power. \n\nMuch of what is known about the IX is sourced from encounters by the Terran Intervention Corps, with the Terran government being uncharacteristically open and cooperative in sharing intelligence regarding the type. Military analysts have attached the "Reclamation" title to these vessels, concluding that they are a reactive, last-ditch attempt by the Xenon to secure certain "core" sectors under threat, by dedicating all remaining available resources to their production in hopes of re-establishing the local presence once the sector is cleared of hostiles. As the ships have been observed seemingly appearing from nowhere even after the destruction of local Xenon shipbuilding facilities, it is theorized that they are assembled under asteroid cover or heavy sensor jamming fields, utilizing the same in-situ bootstrapped self-assembly technology that has been observed in the construction of Xenon stations.</t>

	<t id="11">Once the first and only Teladi Sector bordering the Paranid, Bad Debt quickly fell into disuse with only a few Paranid ships entering for supplies despite relations between the two slowly improving. The situation for Bad Debt rapidly deteriorated during the beginnings of the Gate Shutdown and while they were initially still connected to the network eventually both gates deactivated and the sector was lost to the dark. \n\nVery little information has been recovered regarding the sector but what is known is that sometime after the shutdown, a now dormant gate reactivated and a swarm of Xenon emerged, plunged the sector into chaos, and destroyed all life. Now it is not only an embarrassing reminder to the Teladi for their past bad investment but also a painful reminder to those who were lost. \n\nWhile the sector was mostly devoid of resources in the past, it is now saturated due to the Xenon's destruction of a local moon via unknown means.</t>

	<t id="21">Identified as a heavily entrenched Xenon sector prior to the shutdown, #695 was barely explored due to the extreme risk to pilots and the data corruption of remote drones.

	<!--TURRETS/WEAPONS DESCRIPTIONS-->
	<t id="300">Size: SMALL\n Weapon Class: BOMBER\n\nThe Light Plasma Bomb is a standardized, near-universally compatible weapon intended to be fitted to the heavy ordnance hardpoint found on bomber-type attack craft.\n\nA derivative offshoot of the ubiquitous Plasma Cannon technology, the weapon fires a highly unstable ionized plasma mixture held within a transient containment field. Upon impact the projectile loses containment and produces a high-energy flare, causing significant damage to anything unlucky enough to be caught within the sizable blast radius. Though very destructive, the projectiles have an extremely poor velocity and effective range due to containment bleed-off, making the weapon largely ineffective when deployed against anything other than its intended capital-class targets.</t>	
	<t id="301">Size: LARGE\n\nThis modified version of the standard Argon-built Photon Pulse Cannon was developed specifically for use as the primary armament of the Boron Marlin frigate. \n\nThough it uses the same underlying operating principles as the Argon progenitor, the Boron version of the PPC has been re-engineered to fit Boron power architecture and tactical sensibilities, boasting greater engagement distance at the cost of limited gimbal range and incompatibility with non-Boron ship systems.</t> 
	<t id="302">This piece of equipment is used to assist Viper missile frigate captains in maintaining proper distance from their intended targets. \n\nWhile manually operated rangefinding and targeting devices are a primitive solution dating back to pre-spaceflight era, their adoption has been highly effective in curtailing Split captains' tendency to grow bored in their standoff fire support role and demanding that their ship "close with the enemy, so that they may strike them with their blade", by giving them something to do. The additional benefits of slightly reduced target acquisition times and marginally improved terminal guidance are seen as welcome but ultimately unnecessary side effects. </t>	
	<t id="303">A sophisticated target acquisition and tracking suite utilizing a human-in-the-loop advanced long-range recognition system, initially designed for the Kitsune. \n\nThough the early trial versions of the system were fully automated and demonstrated excellent performance, battlefield experience revealed that in the heat of combat, the inability of the crew to directly influence the ship's armament produced a variety of psychological effects that manifested in poor tactical judgement and significantly impaired combat efficiency. By reintroducing the human factor at several critical points of the target engagement process, these issues were eliminated and overall combat effectiveness saw an notable improvement, even in low-pressure trial scenarios.</t>

	<t id="800">A new development and seldom seen outside of Split space, the Cheetah is a light carrier ostensibly built in a bout of cooperation among the Split Free Families as a more specifically tailored version of the Split Panther. However, observers have noted that the Cheetah's unique capabilities are oddly well-suited to the lightning-fast ambush raids carried out by Fallen Families raiders, and the ship is just as commonly seen wearing Fallen Families colors as it is in Free Families livery, leading to a widely-accepted theory that the ship was in fact built to the specifications of an influential Fallen Families warband. \n\nRegardless of the truth of its origins, the Cheetah itself is an extremely capable raider - boasting an exceptionally high top speed along with an L-class turret hardpoint, a very large fighter capacity, and numerous launch tubes to rapidly surprise and overwhelm a target with fighters. However it is much less capable than its peers when it comes under direct threat, having poor shielding and only a small number of M-class defensive turrets. In addition, the Cheetah is fitted with relatively few landing pads, making it slow to recover its fighter complement. Alongside its limited capacity for self-defense against peer targets, this means that Cheetah captains must remain mindful of not only their attack vectors, but also be constantly planning an exit strategy should the tides of battle turn against them.</t>	
	<t id="801">The Chiba E is the Terran refinement of the Pioneers' original converted design. In a rare display of technological acknowledgement, the Terran Protectorate purchased access to the Chiba's design specifications and soon placed an improved version into service. While the design heritage of the Hokkaido hull remains clearly evident, the Chiba E is built to purpose from the keel up; featuring numerous internal modifications and improvements including expanded fighter-handling facilities and dedicated launch tubes, the ship has greatly improved performance in the light carrier role. \n\nIdentical in function to the original, the Chiba E is commonly seen patrolling Terran space, serving as a base for or as small task force leaders.</t>

	<t id="810">The Split Wolf bomber is one of the largest and deadliest S-class combat ships, surpassing even the powerful Chimera. Developed with the assistance of OTAS engineers under a diplomatic effort to cooperate against their enemy, the Argon Federation, the Wolf makes use of technologies first pioneered for the OTAS Notus bomber, adapted for the generally lower Commonwealth technology base. Though relatively slow and a large target, the Wolf has a powerful arsenal of weapons fitted to a heavily reinforced hull, and in numbers presents a formidable threat to capital-class targets of any size. \n\nWith the Wolf demonstrating an integration of OTAS and Commonwealth engineering, the technology soon spread through the Gate Network, with other powers fielding their own bomber-type vessels.</t>
	<t id="811">The Terran Falchion bomber is perhaps the most heavily specialized ship in the class. While broadly identical in strategic function as the Notus and other Commonwealth counterparts, the Falchion does not use any version of the Notus' technology, and was developed and built completely from scratch by Terran engineers. \n\nUnlike other bombers, the Falchion carries no secondary armament to accompany the ordnance hardpoints, and is largely reliant on fighter escorts to clear the battlespace. In exchange, the ship presents a very small target profile and possesses robust shielding, maximizing its survivability against its capital sized targets. </t>

	<t id="820">A cooperative effort between Boron and Argon engineers, the Marlin is a frigate built with lessons learned from encounters with Split and Xenon forces following the reconnection of Boron space to the wider Commonwealth. Having identified a need for heavier anti-capital firepower than that provided by the larger Ray, the Marlin is designed with a unique (among Boron vessels) primary weapon hardpoint capable of mounting the powerful Argon Photon Pulse Cannon. Coupled with its small size and reduced price compared to a full destroyer, a squadron of Marlins can match the firepower of much larger vessels and overwhelm otherwise superior foes while maintaining cost parity.\n\nBased on a heavily redesigned version of their previous Sturgeon hull, the Marlin represents a surprising breakthrough success for the nascent Stellar Shores Shipping company, providing their first foothold in the highly competitive military procurement market and placing them solidly in line with their older, more established corporate peers.</t>

	  <!-- TMs -->
	<t id="830">A class of ship that fell out of favour during the Shutdown-Era, TM-class Military Transports serve dual roles as well-defended couriers of sensitive cargo and as cost-effective solutions for low-intensity patrol and police duties.\n\nThough they were largely unneeded during the isolation of the Gate Shutdown, the class was reintroduced following the Reconnection to alleviate the increased pressure placed on military forces by the rise in inter-faction tensions and Xenon activity, replacing frontline-capable combat units in second-line roles. Traditionally built on a modified civilian transport hull, TM-class vessels sacrifice a large portion of their cargo capacity in exchange for handling and servicing equipment to support a small wing of fighters. Rather than traditional docking pads, TMs are fitted with short range graviton tractor beam arrays to hold docked fighters in place, using a standard service umbilical to transfer crew between vessels rather than maintaining an "open-space" atmospheric envelope. Though this allows TMs to carry a large number of parasite fighters for their size, the lack of internal storage bays means that the externally-docked fighters are vulnerable to damage and the ship can only realistically support as many fighters as it can dock. \n\nThe Split-built Crocodile is one of the smallest ships in the class, though it still manages to land a wing of four heavy fighters and features the aggressive speed common to Split designs.</t>

Though lightly armed, like its transporter ancestor, the Helianthus boasts improved shielding and excellent mobility.</t>

	<t id="1100">{20111,5302} {20101,100401}(Standard Defence Drone)</t>
	<t id="11001">The product of a joint Argon-Teladi venture to produce a new generation of cheap defence drone following the Gate Reconnection, the Universal Standard-Armaments Semi-Autonomous Fighter Drone - more commonly referred to as the Commonwealth Standard defence drone, or simply the Standard - is a massive commercial and military success that can be found both in service and available for sale throughout every corner of settled space. \n\nThough the design has begun to significantly show its age in the modern battlespace and brings very little in the way of individual combat power, decades of design maturation and manufacturing refinements have driven the cost of the Standard down to practically nothing, letting even the most cash-strapped freighter captain freely deploy them in bulk as disposable countermeasures against pirate attack. This has ensured the continued popularity of the Standard despite its perceived obsolescence in frontline military use.</t>	
	<t id="1101">{20202,601} {20101,100401}(Xenon Defence Drone)</t>
	<t id="11011">Little is known about the Xenon defence drone beyond the proven fact that it is tactically superior to any of its counterparts. Beyond being larger, more robust and having better armament, Xenon AGI systems also ensure the drone is smarter and meaner than any other drone system. A swarm of Xenon drones can swiftly bring down an underprepared foe of any size and present a formidable obstacle when contesting battlespace control of Xenon-occupied systems.</t>	
	<t id="1102">Keris Defence Drone(Terran)</t>
	<t id="11021">The modern incarnation of Terran Keris defence drone is a powerful and advanced semiautomonous weapons system. Though somewhat slower than its Commonwealth counterparts, the Keris presents a reduced target profile and possesses superior armament in the form of a standard Terran Pulse Cannon.</t>	
	<t id="1103">Krill Defence Drone(Boron)</t>
	<t id="11031">Designed in a bid to reduce casualty risk to fighter pilots, the Krill defense drone is a very agile drone armed with a single Ion Gatling. \n\nAccording to Boron fleet doctrine, correct usage of the Krill drone in a coordinated fleet action sees it deployed in large numbers alongside manned fighters, using its physical presence to distract enemy fire and the engine-disrupting properties of the Ion Gatling to pull apart enemy formations, thus allowing crewed fighters to deliver decisive tactical strikes in relative safety. </t>	
	<t id="1104">Skink Defence Drone(Split)</t>
	<t id="11041">A highly conventional application of Split combat philosophy, the Split-designed Skink defence drone is extremely fast and mounts a deadly Tau Accelerator as the main weapon system, giving it an unexpected edge in combat when facing larger targets.</t>	
	<t id="1105">Cupid Defence Drone(Paranid)</t>
	<t id="11051">As much a product of cultural dogma as one of military necessity, the Paranid Cupid defence drone was initially designed by the Holy Order to both provide their forces with a combat advantage and to free their captains from the perceived shame of relying on the heretical Standard drone. The Holy Order enjoyed a brief period of drone superiority before the design was acquired by the Godrealm, which swiftly adopted the system and began to field their own copy. \n\nArmed with a scaled-down version of the Paranid Railgun system, the Cupid gives Paranid forces a unique form of offensive support.</t>
