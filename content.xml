<content id="reemergence" name="X4:Reemergence" description="Completely overhauls the game map by adding ~80 new sectors, 2 new Xenon ship variants, and the return of OTAS with unique equipment and ships (or variants). New sectors are all from X3 or (unused X4) and are fully voiced while being recreated with effort made to make them as similar is possible but balanced for X4. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is designed to be played with VRO enabled but it should work without. It is also meant to be used in tandem with DA's AI mods and/or Faction Enhancers and/or FOCW as the additional sectors necessitate more adaptive AI. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a BETA version! Some features are currently absent, stats might be unbalanced, and things are subject to change following feedback." author="X4:RE Team" version="188" date="2025-09-15" save="0" enabled="1">
